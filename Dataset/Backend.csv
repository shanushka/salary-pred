9,Backend Engineer,Wealthfront,"Palo Alto, CA 94301",Remote,"$142,000 - $169,000 ",r - Full-time,"About Wealthfront
Wealthfront’s vision is to make it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth on your own terms. This vision is relevant because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We want to empower young investors to easily explore and execute on a wider range of investing strategies. We want to help them make informed investment decisions that are consistent with their values and beliefs while also making it effortless to grow and compound their savings exponentially. We believe that doing so will be transformational to their lives and their long-term future.

About Wealthfront Engineering
At Wealthfront, engineering is the largest group with over 50% of the employees. Hence engineering culture permeates throughout the organization. You will work with and learn from invigorating colleagues who come from diverse backgrounds. Very few had a finance background before starting at Wealthfront. Given our size - about 240 employees in total and about 125 employees in Engineering, you have the ability to have an outsized impact, regardless of your industry tenure. Our Banking system was designed and first developed by an engineer 3 years out of college. The Linking platform was developed by engineers with up to 6 years industry experience. When you start we will pair you up with a mentor who will guide you for as long as you want. Our culture is optimized for continued learning and automation. At Wealthfront we are builder/operators: engineers have the dual responsibility to build the system and operate the system in production, dealing with problems as they occur. This provides you direct feedback on how your code performs in production. We preach and practice automation. As an engineer, you are expected to automate any toil you encounter. No permissions required, no prioritizations expected, no questions asked. We are disciples of quality and we don’t have a separate QA organization. Engineers are expected to write automated test cases that build upon the existing test cases. For example, our investing algorithms have a dedicated suite of tests that runs full trading day simulations on a representative sample of real accounts. This testing framework allows us to test any code change against historical scenarios. If our culture of learning, the potential to have a huge impact, and our focus on quality resonates with you, then we want you!

Note: This role has the option to be based in Palo Alto CA, Boston MA, or remote (U.S)
About the Role:
We are looking for backend engineers to join our core product development teams. You’ll work with other engineers to design and build new features or enhance existing features. This work will add capabilities to the various backend systems and services that support Wealthfront’s products, and will be done with automated instrumentation and monitoring to require minimal operational maintenance.
You’ll help improve the maintainability and stability of our codebase by fixing issues and adding necessary enhancements to our existing backend systems. You’ll ensure that mission critical backend systems and services operate smoothly in production by triaging and resolving operational issues as part of a team of on-call engineers. You’ll proactively identify opportunities for improving the reliability and scalability of our systems.
Additionally, you might play a part in evolving the engineering organization by participating in recruiting activities such as interviewing and attending career fairs and providing mentorship to other engineers on the team.
About You:
You have 1-3 years of experience in developing backend components, services or APIs in Java or a similar language. You demonstrate knowledge and understanding of distributed systems and functional programming paradigms. You have knowledge of SQL and experience working with online data stores (ideally something like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server but NoSQL is okay).
You have passion for agile, test-driven development, continuous integration and automated testing. You also have a passion for working on platforms and backend systems that have measurable business impact and like working in a fast paced cross functional environment.
While not required, experience working with Spark pipelines is a plus along with knowledge of an ORM technology such as Hibernate. Another plus is working with a dependency injection framework (one of Guice, Spring, Pico, Dagger).
You have either a BS or MS in computer science or related field.
Once you join, Wealthfront will:
Pair you with a mentor who will guide you through our structured onboarding program
Encourage you to work on projects that match your professional goals
Support your professional development by providing feedback during weekly 1:1s and our semi-annual reviews
Provide you autonomy so you can be a happy and successful member of our team
Estimated annual salary range: $142,000 - $169,000 USD plus Equity.
Plus benefits include medical, vision, dental, 401K plan, generous time off, parental leave, wellness reimbursements, professional development, employee investing discount, and more!

Everyone across the financial spectrum deserves to live secure and rewarding lives. In order to successfully serve clients across the United States, the Wealthfront team is focused on hiring team members with a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.


About Wealthfront

Wealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business, with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built the first automated investment product that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee; we then expanded into banking which made it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $27 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry. And yet, we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions.

Wealthfront’s vision is to make it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth on your own terms. This vision is more relevant than ever because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth.

Position Type: Full-Time
Location: San Francisco, CA / Remote (USA)
Salary: $200,000+
Equity: 0.1-0.2%

\uD83C\uDF0F About Heard
Heard's (https://joinheard.com/) mission is to help therapists with their businesses.

By helping them take care of all their business needs — accounting, taxes, bookkeeping & more, we create a world where therapists can focus on the thing they know best: helping their clients.

Unlike most small businesses, mental health providers lack the tools and systems needed to understand the ins and outs of their business. They're forced to work with a disparate array of expensive services or contractors to manage their finances, their taxes, their payroll, their savings and more. Not only is this outside their area of expertise — every hour spent wrangling finances or filling out forms is one less hour spent providing care.

Heard offers therapists bookkeeping, accounting, taxes, and payroll all in one easy-to-use platform.

Heard is growing incredibly fast. We launched in Jan 2021, and most recently raised our Series A in Feb of 2022. We have a clear, well-funded pathway to becoming an industry leading software services provider for independent mental health practitioners.

You have 8+ years of relevant experience as a backend engineer or API engineer
You care deeply about writing easily maintainable, well-structured code. You enjoy discussing the pros and cons of various architectural implementations
You take into consideration the business impact when solving technical problems.
You're a great communicator and collaborator, and have a knack for teaching and sharing your knowledge. You're comfortable with regularly providing feedback, and open to receiving feedback
You love working with a small (yet mighty) team!
If you've built products in the fintech industry, or worked on products that have handled financial information before, that's a huge plus!

At Levro (Y S21), our mission is to build the financial backbone for global commerce. We are building financial infrastructure to allow any company to frictionlessly expand to any country. We help companies avoid complex/costly conversions, by holding 30+ different currencies in one US bank account. This means they can receive and pay funds internationally as if they had a local bank account, and our FX conversion fees are 4-8x cheaper than traditional banks.
Opening a bank account abroad as a business can be really hard: it can take up to 6 months in the UK, and you often even need to fly to Canada to open a Canadian bank account! Once accounts are open, banks charge high fees to convert between currencies, and the setup can be complicated to administer.
We closed an oversubscribed seed round from incredible fintech investors and operators, including YCombinator and the founders of Yahoo, Eventbrite, Monzo and others. We're 2x YC founders and experienced operators - Cathy founded a big data SaaS business that processed over $4bn in transactions, and Abeer built a hedge fund with over $1.5bn in AUM.

Experience in working in financial services is nice, but by no means a requirement.
Our Tech Stack:
Python - we have a simple Flask backend, connected to a few other services, all in Python
AWS - Docker containers running on ECS

A holistic financial health company helping every American build a brighter financial future. With a business model that is aligned with our customers, we create transparent, fair, and simple financial products that put money back in the hands of our members, help them spend wisely, avoid unfair fees and build their credit quickly. We're backed by leading VC's including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DCM, a number of the world's most influential social impact investors like Flourish and Sound, and several mission driven celebrity investors like Kevin Durant and Ashton Kutcher! If autonomy, ownership, and having meaningful input at the company you work for is important to you, come join our growing team!
Brigit is doing innovative and exciting work, but don’t just take our word for it, our work is being recognized by others:
Built In’s 2023 Best Startups to Work For In New York City
Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies of 2022
Forbes Fintech 50 2022
Business Insider’s Most Promising Consumer Startups 2022
Brigit is looking for a Frontend Engineer to help us scale our next-gen consumer finance platform. Our product has tremendous traction helping 1 million+ low income Americans make ends meet. We’ve built beautifully designed, user-centric mobile and web clients with React (including React Native) and TypeScript, but we need help in making them even more user friendly & extensible.
As we approach our next phase of growth, we're scoping out new products and features helping our users save more and improve their credit options - in short, better equipping them along their financial journey. You'll have the opportunity to leverage the platform of our current frontend & backend base to build these new products from the ground up for millions of users. Financial products often come with difficult user challenges, and if you're excited by the idea of reconstructing difficult concepts into easy-to-use interfaces and products for end-users, then this is the right role for you.
Our engineering team has two main goals:
1) Ship Features supporting numerous external and internal applications. The next generation of our product may look nothing like what it does today - and we welcome that! The degree to which we design and create new features (and even new products) for users, architect our frontend-backend communications, implement design-to-development processes will make or break our success.
2) Scalability & Maintainability of our user-facing applications. Growing from 100k users to 10 million presents unique technical challenges. Because we’re growing so quickly, the efficiency and reliability of both our customer facing and internal tools needs to improve. In addition to creating new features, we have many tasks to tackle including the creation and upkeep of components & libraries, REST API design, testing & QA processes, and CI/CD enhancements.
The engineering team is small and nimble; you'll get an extraordinary amount of autonomy and ownership. More importantly, you’ll have a large say in the direction of the company - both in terms of our technology and our product. One of our greatest strengths is the speed with which we can move. If you want to propose a new way of doing things, we are all ears. If you have an idea for a new feature, we'll be open to it. A new design paradigm? Bring it on.
At Brigit you'll find engineering best practices inspired by our experiences at Palantir, Amazon, Two Sigma, a mature CI/CD process, an easy-to-use local/staging/production development environment, and teammates willing to fill in the gaps. We automate manual things so we can focus on thinking and building something that truly helps people.
What You Have
3+ years of full-time experience in the React (including React Native) & JavaScript ecosystem
Experience using HTML & CSS to create beautiful interfaces
Up-to-date grasp of the constantly evolving JS language standards, ES6 and beyond
Experience consuming (and spec'ing requirements for) REST APIs
TypeScript or other compile-to-JS language is a plus; Fullstack/Backend experience (esp. in Java) is a plus; quantitative skills, knowledge or experience in Finance is a plus
You are a self-starter, self-motivated, and able to work independently and manage multiple projects under minimal supervision
Experience building UI/UX for new features from end-to-end
The ability to rebuild an internal dashboard from scratch which greatly enhances our internal customer success team’s efficiency
What You'll Be Doing
Implementing interaction and motion design for more delightful user experiences
Unifying our component and styling libraries to be shared across our mobile and web clients
Automating visual testing & visual regression detection processes
Creating new mobile & web clients for upcoming products
Work with the Product & Design teams to spec, build, and ship a new Financial Health Score feature

We have two amazing products to make this real:
Sequence, which consists of i) a friendly crypto + Web3 wallet, and ii) a seamless developer platform for Ethereum, NFTs, Web3, DeFi and Dapps.

And Skyweaver, a digital trading card game—powered by Sequence—where players actually own the game items (NFTs) they win and purchase. For the first time, gamers can easily and securely sell and trade their items.

Sequence is poised to drive Web3 adoption on a massive scale by making blockchain easy, fun and powerful for users and developers. And, Skyweaver has the chance to become a groundbreaking video game with its unprecedented player-owned economy, novel gameplay, and an already fervent community.

While the challenge is hard, we find it incredibly fun. And we have the ingredients to make it happen: a well-capitalized company with some of the best investors in the world (Reddit co-founder, Coinbase), an amazing team of leaders in the blockchain space, engineers who have built widely popular open source, a former top McKinsey strategy consultant, gaming industry veterans, and founders who have built and sold successful companies. You'll get to work with and learn from them all.

About the Role:
We're looking for someone with experience architecting, writing, testing and shipping production-quality code in Go, with a background in Ethereum development. You are rigourous and have a refined eye for simple arhitecture and clean code, and you are able to balance tradeoffs inherent in all design decisions.

You enjoy building scalable, fault-tolerant systems. You understand the meaning of value and delivering products that achieve business outcomes while laying the foundation of great tech that affects our entire org, and is impactful. This matters to you.

As a senior engineer, you have a deep understanding of designing robust, well-designed code with thoughtful architecture. You can drive and self-direct major areas of our stack. While not a strict requirement, you are comfortable working with and guiding more intermediate and junior engineers when needed.

Given our size, self-driven, and open-minded engineers will thrive best in this role. While small, you'll be working alongside some of the best engineers, and open-source contributors—and a company dedicated to your success. You will learn a lot.

Responsibilities:
Architect, develop, and implement the infrastructure, and infrastructure stack of Skyweaver and Sequence
Design and implement services that are scalable, and fault-tolerant
Build services that interface with the Ethereum blockchain
Contribute to open source works in the Sequence stack
Extend and evolve our toolchain, to run our stack effectively
Design architectural foundations that are robust and sound, so that future engineers can build on your work with ease and speed
Requirements:
5+ years shipping production-grade code in Go
Experience and knowledge of the Ethereum blockchain, its tooling and ecosystem
Knowledge of distributed systems design
Experience with data systems, both in their design and practical use
Experience with one of the major cloud providers, AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
Growth mindset. You love to learn, and actively search out new material and technologies
Why Horizon?:
Chance to deliver massive impact at a small and quickly growing company
Accelerate your career by joining at the early stages
Be part of defining Web3, the next generation of the Internet, and creating symbiotic economies where both users and creators share in the value generated by networks
Work with an outstanding team made of wonderful people who have built and sold successful companies, launched amazing products, and have rich experience in infrastructure, architecture, blockchain, games, finance, investing, strategy, consulting, design, marketing, community, and more.

Our products aim to do one thing: save startup founders and small business owners time, money, and peace of mind. We started by demystifying complicated tax credits, saving over $100M – and countless hours of tax code research – for founders in nearly every industry. Since our sort-of viral beginnings in 2019, we’ve raised a $60M Series A, expanded our product lines (with more in the works), and grew from 3 employees to our current team!

We owe our success to the strength of our team. Before joining MainStreet, we helped build companies like Intuit, PayPal, Google, Apple, Coinbase, Gusto, LinkedIn, Slack, and more. We’re fellow founders, engineers, accountants, designers, dog (and cat) lovers, adventurers, coders, and parents. We move fast. We think big. We don’t take ourselves too seriously. And we’d love for you to join us.

Write maintainable, well tested, high quality front-and-backend code
Leverage your previous experience to help us uplevel our teams’ technology and processes, while learning from and collaborating with your MainStreet colleagues
Be a steward of core performance, security, and design principles across our technology stack

5 - 8 years professional experience as a software engineer working across all parts of a modern web stack
A thorough knowledge of modern JavaScript best practices
Prior experience with modern frontend and backend frameworks
Experience writing well-designed APIs and working with backend services
Knowledge of why testing your code is crucial, and experience ensuring high test coverage by writing unit, feature, and e2e tests
A solid product sense - we want to make robust technical decisions with the needs of our users and the business at the forefront
Experience collaborating directly with Product Managers and Designers
A love for learning new things as well as mentoring other team members on their learning journeys as well
Excellent communication skills, both via video chat (Zoom) and in written format (Slack, email, Google Docs)
Self-driven and able to work both independently and collaboratively in a remote environment
Bonus if you have
Previous experience using TypeScript, React, Express, or Node.js in a production application (especially if you’ve also worked on performance optimization in any of these areas)
Experience working within an Agile software development lifecycle
Experience working remotely either full or part-time
Passion for startups, finance, accounting, and taxes, or all of the above
Past experience or interest in working at a startup, or in SMBs, fintech, or product-led growth practices

Bonus that is commensurate with the level of the position
Robust equity program with significant upside potential

Consider us your silent partner-in-savings, your financial secret weapon, your smart (not a) bank – whatever you want to call us. We’ve got your back so you can get back to building your business. ✨

Our $60M Series A

At Horizon, we’re building a New Dimension where Internet economies are fun, accessible, and for the benefit of all participants.

We have two amazing products to make this real:
Sequence, which consists of i) a friendly crypto + Web3 wallet, and ii) a seamless developer platform for Ethereum, NFTs, Web3, DeFi and Dapps.

And Skyweaver, a digital trading card game—powered by Sequence—where players actually own the game items (NFTs) they win and purchase. For the first time, gamers can easily and securely sell and trade their items.

Sequence is poised to drive Web3 adoption on a massive scale by making blockchain easy, fun and powerful for users and developers. And, Skyweaver has the chance to become a groundbreaking video game with its unprecedented player-owned economy, novel gameplay, and an already fervent community.

While the challenge is hard, we find it incredibly fun. And we have the ingredients to make it happen: a well-capitalized company with some of the best investors in the world (Reddit co-founder, Coinbase), an amazing team of leaders in the blockchain space, engineers who have built widely popular open source, a former top McKinsey strategy consultant, gaming industry veterans, and founders who have built and sold successful companies. You'll get to work with and learn from them all.

About the Role:
We're looking for someone with experience architecting, writing, testing and shipping production-quality code in Go, with a background in Ethereum development.

As a senior engineer, you have a deep understanding of designing robust, well-designed code with thoughtful architecture. You can drive and self-direct major areas of our stack. While not a strict requirement, you are comfortable working with and guiding more intermediate and junior engineers when needed.

Given our size, self-driven, and open-minded engineers will thrive best in this role. While small, you'll be working alongside some of the best engineers, and open-source contributors—and a company dedicated to your success. You will learn a lot.

Responsibilities:
Architect, develop, and implement the infrastructure, and infrastructure stack of Skyweaver and Sequence
Design and implement services that are scalable, and fault-tolerant
Build services that interface with the Ethereum blockchain
Contribute to open source works in the Sequence stack
Extend and evolve our toolchain, to run our stack effectively

Requirements:
5+ years shipping production-grade code in Go
Experience and knowledge of the Ethereum blockchain, its tooling and ecosystem
Knowledge of distributed systems design
Experience with data systems, both in their design and practical use
Experience with one of the major cloud providers, AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
Growth mindset. You love to learn, and actively search out new material and technologies

Chance to deliver massive impact at a small and quickly growing company
Accelerate your career by joining at the early stages
Be part of defining Web3, the next generation of the Internet, and creating symbiotic economies where both users and creators share in the value generated by networks
Work with an outstanding team made of wonderful people who have built and sold successful companies, launched amazing products, and have rich experience in infrastructure, architecture, blockchain, games, finance, investing, strategy, consulting, design, marketing, community, and more.

Job description
This role is open to a European based software engineer who wants to work in Rust. Experience in a similar C based programming language, such as C++, or any strictly typed language is required, but the role is open to those wanting to develop their skills in the new world of Rust. Apparently we are one of the few companies in Europe who have built the entire backend in Rust from day one, so that’s neat.
We have multiple possible roles within our backend engineering team, all rust-based.

You will likely focus your efforts on one three areas:
The State Chain: we are developing our own standalone blockchain using the substrate blockchain development framework . Previous experience of working with complex type systems would be beneficial here, as would some knowledge of how blockchains work internally.

The Chainflip Engine: this application works in tandem with the State Chain to power our decentralised threshold signature protocol, and to witness events happening in the outside world. An in-depth knowledge of the challenges of distributed systems, cryptography, and Rust’s async features (specifically the tokio stack) would be great to have.

Tools and testing: security and robustness of our network will be paramount. We need to provide secure and user-friendly tools for our validators to manage their nodes. And we need to be confident our nodes function according to protocol specifications. Knowledge of security best-practices and/or a pedantic and exhaustive attitude to testing would be a big plus here.

No matter which team you join, you will be exposed to all of the tough problems and trade-offs that decentralised finance and blockchains have to offer.

Who we are ?
Chainflip is a decentralised exchange project that uses multi-party-computation and threshold signature schemes to allow our decentralised validator network to secure assets across multiple arbitrarily differentiated blockchain networks, with the ultimate goal of allowing users to swap between various cryptocurrencies across multiple blockchains in a trustless and programmatic way. We think it has the best shot at taking market share away from the big centralised exchanges in the long run and bringing it on-chain. We want to be the Uniswap for everything.
Our values
We are a Berlin-centric team with our own office space in the heart of Kreuzberg, but we have remote workers throughout Europe, a new office in Dublin, and a team in Melbourne, Australia. We meet up as a whole team twice a year, have a very open and flexible culture, and enjoy meaningful personal connections with one another. Our team has a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences to share, and hopefully you’ll be able to share yours with us too."

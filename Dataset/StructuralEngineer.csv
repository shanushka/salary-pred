This is for a Structural Engineer I or II - 0 to 4 years experience
We are looking for an energetic and motivated Structural Engineer to join our Southern California Team. Our scope of work covers structural engineering consulting in the entertainment/museum installation industry. Our structures and clientele almost exclusively live in the temporary structure world; however, our museum and architecture clients do permanent installations as well.
Please note, this is very much a structural engineering position, however, we do not design permanent buildings or bridge structures. If you want to fly Rihanna during Superbowl, this is the place, if you want to design the stadium, we suggest employment elsewhere.
The ideal candidate should have a good understanding of structural design and analyses, but also be able to perform rational based engineering, using engineering theory, to solve structural problems. Not all materials used in architectural and entertainment installations are governed by a direct code. A strong background in hands-on activities is a plus. Most of our clients are not engineers, so a strong understanding of principles and good communication skills are essential.
We are a very hard-working team, but we do not spend all of our time with our noses in our books.

A requirement for this position is site visits for local movie locations and inspections of events. Out of state travel is some what common but will only be required/offered after training. You will be compensated generously for mileage and all fees are expendable. Site visits are project dependent and are not constant. There will be busy times, and slow times. Approximately 15-25% of time is spent in the field.
Desired Skill-Sets:
Strong knowledge of structural design principles and building codes.
Ability to perform structural analysis and design for a variety of structural systems and materials. Not all materials used in the architectural/show world fall into the four basic structural materials. It is our job, as engineers, to understand the materials they have and use rational approaches for safe solutions. Not all materials have codes.
Ability to prepare clear and concise technical reports and design documents not just for engineers, but often for non-engineers.
Good communication skills, including the ability to effectively communicate design concepts and requirements to clients, contractors, and other stakeholders.
Willingness to continually update skills and knowledge in the field of structural engineering.
On-site Inspections as required for structural design or structural safety considerations.
Desired Qualifications:
Bachelor or Masters in Civil / Structural Engineering

While we place a high value on technical skills, we also value the individuality and unique experiences and needs of all our team members. Striving for work life balance, care for each other’s well-being and frequently checking in to make sure team members feel supported and valued is a key part of our success and contentment as a team.

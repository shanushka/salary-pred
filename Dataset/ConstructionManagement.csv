Diverse Assignment Experience - defined as one in which significantly new job skills or knowledge will be/were acquired and successfully demonstrated. These skills must add value to broaden the individual for career path progression to support business needs of the company. New job skills mean a significant change in tasks performed, not just an amplification of existing skills. Rotation to another Energy Northwest organization would usually constitute a diverse assignment; rotation within an organization generally would not be considered diverse. However, the possibility of diverse rotation within an organization exists. Conversely, cross organizational assignments in some groups may not qualify as diverse if the skills or knowledge required are essentially the same. Supervisors and individual contributors should plan future job assignments with the criteria of diversity in mind. A minimum of one-year job duration is recommended to qualify as a diverse assignment. This allows for a full round of performance feedback to document that expected skill or knowledge was attained. Experience within Energy Northwest or external to the company (including external to the nuclear industry) may be credited as diverse assignments. These experiences will be evaluated by Nuclear Projects leadership and Human Resources on an individual basis. The experience must have produced skill or knowledge in an area comparable to those needed within Energy Northwest. Some examples of possible diverse assignments external to Energy Northwest are: startup experience at a fossil plant, design activities for an AE organization, military experiences, time spent as a craftsperson, within the aerospace or semi-conductor industry, or in a QA/QC position. It is recognized that the relative value of an experience may vary between organizations. This list is not intended to be all inclusive and discretion for consideration will be considered by senior manager responsible for Nuclear Projects and Human Resources.

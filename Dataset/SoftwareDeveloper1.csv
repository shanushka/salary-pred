At IBM, work is more than a job - it's a calling: To build. To design. To code. To consult. To think along with clients and sell. To make markets. To invent. To collaborate. Not just to do something better, but to attempt things you've never thought possible. Are you ready to lead in this new era of technology and solve some of the world's most challenging problems? If so, lets talk.

Your Role and Responsibilities

Who You Are
An apprenticeship is about learning. We’re seeking candidates who have the following requirements, but we know you’re just getting your career started, and we’re committed to helping you learn and grow.

Application Development, DevOps automation, and the development toolchain (e.g. Travis, Jenkins, Junit, automated test tools)
What’s the Experience?
As an apprentice, you'll join with other apprentices in a local cohort. You'll go through your first few weeks together, learning about IBM and the skills you'll be attaining throughout your apprenticeship. Then, you'll work with your managers and mentors to progress through your personal skills roadmap, learning and demonstrating new knowledge and competencies through hands-on application with your project teams. You'll complete milestones along the way, earning digital credentials to validate your skills, and will come back together with other apprentices to participate in on-going training and development focused on your professional and technical skills.

As a Software Engineer Apprentice at IBM, you’ll work as part of a larger team of experienced developers and mentors in an interactive, collaborative environment. You’ll learn the fundamentals of development, software design, testing, and cloud computing, agile principles, IBM Design Thinking, DevOps and continuous delivery. You will also learn how to resolve IBM customer issues, debug customer problems and environments, and increase Cloud Service skills, and will build the skills to grow your career as a Software Developer. Best of all, you are a contributing member of your team, putting forward ideas, taking on responsibilities and making choices about how you get the job done just like any other IBMer.

The work location for this position is San Jose, CA. Must be local or willing to relocate at own expense. No relocation is available for this position.

Citi Consumer Technology – Software Development Engineer
Citi Consumer Technology is seeking dozens of talented entry-level software developers for its teams in Dallas, Texas, and Jacksonville, Fla.
We work with a variety of technologies, including Java, iOS, Android and Angular. You’ll find more information below on our roles, our interview process, and our commitment to your growth and development.
Applications are accepted year-round, with multiple start dates organized around orientation trainings.
Our Organization
The best way to think about Citi Consumer Technology is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day.
No matter what development team you’re a part of here, you’ll be solving complex challenges alongside great people.
Your Role
You’d be placed in an Agile development team, building software that impacts millions via consumer applications, customer service channels and internal software. Most teams operate in two- or four-week sprints, building software for a series of major and minor releases throughout the year.
You would have a manager who assesses your performance and evaluates your readiness for mobility or advancement, as well as a dev lead who assigns your work.
You have additional support, too. You join with a cohort of other new hires and go through training together to learn about our company, our tools and processes, and the technical skills you’ll need to succeed.
While technologies can vary slightly from team to team, our developer roles typically break down into these categories:
Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry
iOS: Swift, Xcode, MVC Architecture
Android: Java, Android Studio, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, Java Web Services
Web: Angular (latest version), Eclipse, Java, JSP, TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX
During the interview process, we will work with you to determine which of these roles best suits your skills and interests. Job offers are made with a specific developer role in mind, so you would know your specific position well in advance of joining the company.
Mobility
We highly value developers who build skills in more than one area, so over time, we will look to expose you to a variety of technologies. In fact, some of our teams will expect you to have learned more than one type of dev role within your first year or so. After demonstrating strong performance at the company, there are also opportunities for promotion or to pursue career pathways into other roles and teams.
Training
Soon after joining, you’ll go through several weeks of training to better understand our applications, team structure and processes. You’ll also have a chance to dive deeper into the technical aspects of your role so that you can hit the ground running. Our goal is to equip you with the tools you need to get off to a bright start at Citi.
But the learning can’t stop there. As technology evolves, you must adapt. Through access to additional instructor-led trainings and free access to thousands of hours of content via Udemy, Pluralsight and other online platforms, you’ll never stop growing your skillset.
Communication/Leadership
While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Software Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas.
The Most Important Thing
We believe bright people can learn new things, so while the qualifications below are important, there is one that we absolutely will not compromise on: attitude.
We’re looking for great teammates who are excited to learn new things, motivated to contribute, and eager to collaborate — not compete — with others. We’ve worked hard to build a supportive family environment, and we’re proud to say that candidates and new hires consistently notice it.
This is a place where people look out for one other, build relationships, and help each other succeed.
If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you here!
Qualifications
o Degree, certification or commensurate skills in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related field.
o Hands–on experience developing software.
o Ability to pass technical interviews consisting of basic algorithmic programming exercises.
o Must be collaborative and adaptable, with good communication skills. Prior experience working on agile teams is desirable.
Preferred/Ideal:
o Knowledge of/Experience with Java, IOS, Android, Web Development, or Salesforce App Development.
o Experience with APIs, microservices, or RESTful services.
o Familiarity with the architecture of mobile applications developed for iOS and Android, as well as responsive design for Web.
o Experience designing and interacting with databases.
o Experience implementing business critical, high volume, and highly available web-based applications.
o Experience with, or very knowledgeable in, cloud based development leveraging tools like Pivotal Cloud Foundry in a PaaS environment.
o Knowledge of/Experience with Salesforce CRM Tool.
o Knowledge of/Experience with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools such as Jenkins, Maven, Git, RTC, and/or Jira.
o Experience with Test Driven Development (TDD).
o Salesforce credentials are a plus.
o Experience with Apex development is a plus.
o Experience in the Financial industry is a plus.

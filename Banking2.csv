ABOUT YOU
You’ve been cranking. You know your way around a three statement model, worked on a CIM or ten, and have gotten exposure to transaction processes. You enjoy deconstructing different businesses and helping to craft the investment thesis and value creation narrative.
You're here because there's more to finance than transactions. The deal life may not be the one you aspire to, or represent the primary skill set you wish to develop. You realize that financial planning and analysis (FP&A) processes, including reporting/BI and forecasting capabilities, and building management cultures centered on transparency and accountability, are critical to supporting growth, acquisitions, and eventual business exit. You want access to that FP&A side of the finance function, while still getting the benefits and excitement of deal execution. You've got talent, some corporate finance skills, and now you want to find a place where you can expand your toolbox and accelerate your development.
ABOUT FIRST WATER
First Water connects teams with data and companies with capital by enabling innovative access to finance capabilities and expertise through Relational Finance. Our partner companies include small and midsize businesses (SMBs) and portfolio companies of prominent private equity firms.
Our strength lies in a “mutt culture” formed through experience across finance disciplines and perspectives from both sides of the table. Team backgrounds include financial planning & analysis (FP&A), private equity, investment banking, commercial lending, consulting, and small business leadership. As a result, we are the only firm that:
Designs, develops, and maintains any aspect of the FP&A function, delivering data insights and forward visibility (Managed FP&A);
Manages capital raising and transaction processes with a deep capital network to bring the right partners to the table (Capital & Transaction Initiatives);
Serves as a tactical strike force for project-based initiatives, with a decade of success serving portfolio companies of private equity firms (Finance Acceleration); and,
Activates finance capabilities for SMBs earlier, more cost effectively, and for longer relationship durations by drawing from a holistic finance toolbox, multiple engagement models, and a team-based approach (Relational Finance).
TEAM CULTURE
To build the next generation of finance professionals, we pound the drum on an operational culture that promotes access to opportunities and allows voices to be heard. Key components are as follows:
Be a Mutt. You’re here because you strive to expand your experience and knowledge sets within finance, business, and varied situations/circumstances. You actively seek to step outside your comfort zone and advocate for opportunities to step up to the plate. In doing so, you do what it takes to get yourself up the curve in real time while managing deliverable timelines.
Value is our Output. Everything we do for our companies is connected to growing, preserving, and/or monetizing business value. You step back from technical work to synthesize the why and how it matters for various stakeholders. The purpose of data is dialogue, and our companies rely on us to deliver value, not just numbers.
Best Idea Wins. We are always better than we were [insert some period of time ago]. It is our responsibility and privilege to find better paths to deliver results to our partner companies. You think critically about innovation and tech-enablement and speak up in contributing to process improvements. It is better to be wrong than to not have an opinion.
Transparency is the Process. Our companies rely on us to lead and/or own critical processes they otherwise cannot manage internally. You lean into project management and documentation to provide internal and external visibility and drive confidence in our ability to consistently deliver. Transparency is not part of the process, it is the process.
Pedigree is not a KPI. We work in a sector (finance) where pedigree often serves as a barrier to entry. You don’t assign value based on names on a CV or letters after a name, and you treat team members and customers accordingly. Coachability, work ethic, professionalism, and intellectual curiosity move the needle here.
JOB DESCRIPTION – ASSOCIATE
We are a growing, scrappy team seeking another professional to join our team as an Associate. This role is particularly attractive for somebody seeking to expand his/her finance skill sets, including:
Core FP&A processes (financial and operational reporting, 13-week cash flow forecasting, three statement budgeting and forecasting);
Financial modeling (deployment of internal build methodologies and bespoke/ad-hoc builds);
Data structuring/organization and Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) mechanics;
Data transformation and visualization (business intelligence, particularly Power BI);
Consultative communication for discovery, design, and presentation of deliverables with partner company management and lenders/investors;
Project management and process documentation; and,
Transaction process and due diligence support.
Many traditional finance roles run a high risk of pigeon-holing, as professionals become more and more versed in a single company, industry, system environment, and/or set of processes. At First Water, we believe learned skills should open exposure to other disciplines and perspectives, not just the next rung on ladder. As a result, we are not only building a better set of finance solutions for businesses, but we are also building the environment to cultivate better finance professionals.
Responsibilities:
Execute on all phases of partner company initiatives spanning FP&A and corporate development, including project management, discovery and design, component builds, recurring process maintenance, and stakeholder communication.
Deliverable examples include management reporting packages, BI dashboards, 13- week cashflow forecasts, driver-based three statement models, custom forecast builds, management/board presentations, and other ad-hoc requests.
Process documentation and quality control.
Occasional travel to client sites (infrequent since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic).
Qualifications:
2-3 years in Corporate Finance roles (investment banking, private equity, etc.).
Ability to operate independently and drive deliverable work streams, while knowing when to raise your hand for help and not spin your wheels.
""Competition-level"" Excel skills and supreme attention to detail.
Desire and ability to quickly build competency in data transformation and visualization tools, particularly the Microsoft Power Suite (Pivot/Query/BI).
Strong PowerPoint and presentation building skills.
Additional Details – Financial Modeling:
A strong financial modeling skill set is integral to the position, with a preference for experience in: three-statement financial analysis, corporate finance/capitalization analysis, budgeting/forecasting, reporting/KPI dashboard templates, financial projections, working capital analysis, profitability/performance analysis, and manipulation of non-financial/operational data sets.
A financial modeling assessment will be conducted as part of the interview process.

ABOUT YOU
You’ve been cranking. You know your way around a three statement model, worked on a CIM or ten, and have gotten exposure to transaction processes. You enjoy deconstructing different businesses and helping to craft the investment thesis and value creation narrative.
You're here because there's more to finance than transactions. The deal life may not be the one you aspire to, or represent the primary skill set you wish to develop. You realize that financial planning and analysis (FP&A) processes, including reporting/BI and forecasting capabilities, and building management cultures centered on transparency and accountability, are critical to supporting growth, acquisitions, and eventual business exit. You want access to that FP&A side of the finance function, while still getting the benefits and excitement of deal execution. You've got talent, some corporate finance skills, and now you want to find a place where you can expand your toolbox and accelerate your development.
ABOUT FIRST WATER
First Water connects teams with data and companies with capital by enabling innovative access to finance capabilities and expertise through Relational Finance. Our partner companies include small and midsize businesses (SMBs) and portfolio companies of prominent private equity firms.
Our strength lies in a “mutt culture” formed through experience across finance disciplines and perspectives from both sides of the table. Team backgrounds include financial planning & analysis (FP&A), private equity, investment banking, commercial lending, consulting, and small business leadership. As a result, we are the only firm that:
Designs, develops, and maintains any aspect of the FP&A function, delivering data insights and forward visibility (Managed FP&A);
Manages capital raising and transaction processes with a deep capital network to bring the right partners to the table (Capital & Transaction Initiatives);
Serves as a tactical strike force for project-based initiatives, with a decade of success serving portfolio companies of private equity firms (Finance Acceleration); and,
Activates finance capabilities for SMBs earlier, more cost effectively, and for longer relationship durations by drawing from a holistic finance toolbox, multiple engagement models, and a team-based approach (Relational Finance).
TEAM CULTURE
To build the next generation of finance professionals, we pound the drum on an operational culture that promotes access to opportunities and allows voices to be heard. Key components are as follows:
Be a Mutt. You’re here because you strive to expand your experience and knowledge sets within finance, business, and varied situations/circumstances. You actively seek to step outside your comfort zone and advocate for opportunities to step up to the plate. In doing so, you do what it takes to get yourself up the curve in real time while managing deliverable timelines.
Value is our Output. Everything we do for our companies is connected to growing, preserving, and/or monetizing business value. You step back from technical work to synthesize the why and how it matters for various stakeholders. The purpose of data is dialogue, and our companies rely on us to deliver value, not just numbers.
Best Idea Wins. We are always better than we were [insert some period of time ago]. It is our responsibility and privilege to find better paths to deliver results to our partner companies. You think critically about innovation and tech-enablement and speak up in contributing to process improvements. It is better to be wrong than to not have an opinion.
Transparency is the Process. Our companies rely on us to lead and/or own critical processes they otherwise cannot manage internally. You lean into project management and documentation to provide internal and external visibility and drive confidence in our ability to consistently deliver. Transparency is not part of the process, it is the process.
Pedigree is not a KPI. We work in a sector (finance) where pedigree often serves as a barrier to entry. You don’t assign value based on names on a CV or letters after a name, and you treat team members and customers accordingly. Coachability, work ethic, professionalism, and intellectual curiosity move the needle here.
JOB DESCRIPTION – ASSOCIATE
We are a growing, scrappy team seeking another professional to join our team as an Associate. This role is particularly attractive for somebody seeking to expand his/her finance skill sets, including:
Core FP&A processes (financial and operational reporting, 13-week cash flow forecasting, three statement budgeting and forecasting);
Financial modeling (deployment of internal build methodologies and bespoke/ad-hoc builds);
Data structuring/organization and Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) mechanics;
Data transformation and visualization (business intelligence, particularly Power BI);
Consultative communication for discovery, design, and presentation of deliverables with partner company management and lenders/investors;
Project management and process documentation; and,
Transaction process and due diligence support.
Many traditional finance roles run a high risk of pigeon-holing, as professionals become more and more versed in a single company, industry, system environment, and/or set of processes.

History of WNB Financial
Since 1874 WNB Financial has been an important part of the heritage and history of Winona, MN. WNB Financial’s downtown building was erected in 1916, originally housing both the Winona Savings Bank and the newly formed Winona National Bank.
Shortly after the historic building at 204 Main Street opened, the two banks merged to form ""Winona National and Savings Bank"". In 2001, Winona National and Savings Bank merged with its sister-bank, Town and Country State Bank, to once again form ""Winona National Bank"". At the time of this merger, both banks were subsidiaries of WNB Holding Company. The merger allowed a consolidation of processing, combining of expertise, and three convenient locations in Winona: East, West, and Downtown. In 2017, a loan production office was opened in Eau Claire, Wis., to expand commercial loan services into the Chippewa Valley.
A new name, WNB Financial, was announced in June 2018 to help support our long-term objective for continued growth in and outside of Winona.

At PlainsCapital, we’ve always had a trailblazing spirit.

Alan, who retired from his post as Chairman of PlainsCapital Bank in 2019, partnered with a team of young bankers who dreamed of bringing relationship banking to Lubbock, and they began to grow the bank one relationship at a time.

Today, PlainsCapital Bank is one of the largest banks in Texas based on deposit market share. Under the leadership of President and Chief Executive Officer Jerry Schaffner, we have a statewide presence with more than 60 locations in all major Texas markets.

Ever dreamed of coming to work and controlling your deals from start to finish? Tired of 7 levels of management slowing you down? Want to make the money of management without the responsibility of that role?
Our unique setup allows for you to do just that- sell, finance and deliver your customers cradle to grave. Support staff where you need it, very little oversight and a steady stream of qualified leads.
About us-
RV Depot is a 33 year old company with just under 100 employees. We operate out of a 20 acre dealership with a 36,000 sq ft showroom and state of the art shop.

For our employees, we offer competitive pay, a full benefits package and a positive work environment. We keep red tape to a minimum with limited management structure and a company wide open door policy, including our owner.
About this position-
Our company has some of the nicest preowned inventory in the country and our prime placement on Main St in Cleburne puts us right in the middle of RV country. Our marketing brings in customers from all over the country and we leverage technology to make their buying experience second to none. 80% of our customers are shopping for our in-house finance product and we are well staffed to handle this market.
20% of our customers are shopping for traditional finance and cash purchases and we are severely understaffed in this area- we have 10-15 customers on average per day and only 1 employee servicing these customers.
The role we are offering serves this customer base- work the lead into a sale, submit for financing, contracting and delivery all in one.
You will report directly to the GM and owner. No sales manager, sales director, etc.
Compensation is 10% of net profit, paid of front and back. No pack, no hidden fees or costs. Guarantee at least $5000 per month.
If interested in this position, I prefer you come see me in person. I am on property T-F 9am to 7pm, Sat 9-6 and I will stop what I'm doing to talk with you and show you our operation. THIS IS NOT A POSITION FOR THOSE WITH NO EXPERIENCE. I have those positions as well, but not this role.

671,RV Sales and Finance,RV Depot,"Cleburne, TX",Onsite,"$60,000 - $250,000 ",r - Full-time,"RV Depot, a family owned and operated RV dealership, is hiring RV sales professionals interested in controlling their own profits and making BIG MONEY!
Ever dreamed of coming to work and controlling your deals from start to finish? Tired of 7 levels of management slowing you down? Want to make the money of management without the responsibility of that role?
Our unique setup allows for you to do just that- sell, finance and deliver your customers cradle to grave. Support staff where you need it, very little oversight and a steady stream of qualified leads.
About us-
RV Depot is a 33 year old company with just under 100 employees. We operate out of a 20 acre dealership with a 36,000 sq ft showroom and state of the art shop. We carry over 400 RV's at all times and sell around 80 units a month. We are an entrepreneurial business with a growth mindset and we love new ideas.
For our employees, we offer competitive pay, a full benefits package and a positive work environment. We keep red tape to a minimum with limited management structure and a company wide open door policy, including our owner.
About this position-
Our company has some of the nicest preowned inventory in the country and our prime placement on Main St in Cleburne puts us right in the middle of RV country. Our marketing brings in customers from all over the country and we leverage technology to make their buying experience second to none. 80% of our customers are shopping for our in-house finance product and we are well staffed to handle this market.
20% of our customers are shopping for traditional finance and cash purchases and we are severely understaffed in this area- we have 10-15 customers on average per day and only 1 employee servicing these customers.
The role we are offering serves this customer base- work the lead into a sale, submit for financing, contracting and delivery all in one.
You will report directly to the GM and owner. No sales manager, sales director, etc.
Compensation is 10% of net profit, paid of front and back. No pack, no hidden fees or costs. Guarantee at least $5000 per month.
If interested in this position, I prefer you come see me in person. I am on property T-F 9am to 7pm, Sat 9-6 and I will stop what I'm doing to talk with you and show you our operation. THIS IS NOT A POSITION FOR THOSE WITH NO EXPERIENCE. I have those positions as well, but not this role.

Tasca Family Commitment
Tasca Automotive Group was founded in 1943 by Bob Tasca, Sr. In 1953 Bob opened the original Tasca Ford in Bristol, Rhode Island. Just one year later this dealership was completely destroyed by Hurricane Carol. Bob relocated and ultimately opened up the new Tasca Ford at 777 Taunton Avenue in East Providence, Rhode Island. It was here that Bob and his team became the second largest Ford dealership in the world in the 1960's. This was also the birthplace of the Tasca Racing program and many historic muscle cars such as the Ford Cobra Jet, Tasca Street Boss, and Mystery race cars.



Bob opened Tasca Lincoln Mercury in Seekonk, Massachusetts in 1972. TLM became the highest volume Lincoln Mercury dealership in the world in 1986, and repeated again in 1987 and 1988 while also winning the Ford President's Award for outstanding customer satisfaction. This fulfilled Bob's dream of saying ""None Bigger, None Better."" It was also at the Seekonk store that Bob launched the innovative Pre-Trade program, pioneering the concept of short term trade cycles and leasing. He was also joined in the business by his three sons, thus fulfilling another of his dreams to build a successful family business.



In 2002 Bob opened his flagship dealership in Cranston, RI. Featuring Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Mazda, and Volvo the Cranston location was one of the most high tech and largest facilities in the country. It featured amenities such as drive in service write up, an in house Italian café, drive through carwash, and spacious customer lounge. It was at this time that Bob was joined in the business by his grandsons and granddaughters, continuing his dream of a family business. When Bob Tasca, Sr. passed away in 2010 he left a proud legacy of honesty, integrity, and customer satisfaction.



70 years and three generations later the Tasca Family continues to grow. We have been blessed over the past seven decades with great customers and great employees. We would like to thank the members of our team who continue to work so hard to satisfy our customers. We would also like to thank the thousands of families who have trusted us over the past 70 years. We humbly look forward to keeping our commitment that YOU WILL BE SATISFIED.

This fulfilled Bob's dream of saying ""None Bigger, None Better."" It was also at the Seekonk store that Bob launched the innovative Pre-Trade program, pioneering the concept of short term trade cycles and leasing. He was also joined in the business by his three sons, thus fulfilling another of his dreams to build a successful family business.




In 2002 Bob opened his flagship dealership in Cranston, RI. Featuring Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Mazda, and Volvo the Cranston location was one of the most high tech and largest facilities in the country. It featured amenities such as drive in service write up, an in house Italian café, drive through carwash, and spacious customer lounge. It was at this time that Bob was joined in the business by his grandsons and granddaughters, continuing his dream of a family business. When Bob Tasca, Sr. passed away in 2010 he left a proud legacy of honesty, integrity, and customer satisfaction.


70 years and three generations later the Tasca Family continues to grow. We have been blessed over the past seven decades with great customers and great employees. We would like to thank the members of our team who continue to work so hard to satisfy our customers. We would also like to thank the thousands of families who have trusted us over the past 70 years. We humbly look forward to keeping our commitment that YOU WILL BE SATISFIED.

Background


UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security.
The Policy, Programme and Intergovernmental Division develops and implements UN Women’s programme of work across its normative, coordination, and operational triple mandate and provides policy advice and guidance and technical support to intergovernmental processes, UN system, and UN Women regional and country offices, among other partners and stakeholders. The Division is organized in thematic sections, which undertake policy research; analyze data on country, regional and global trends; and propose evidence-based options for global policy, norms and standards as well as for UN Women’s policy advocacy and global programme strategies, including flagship programme initiatives. The Division also undertakes substantive preparations for the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and drafts reports on behalf of the Secretary-General on multiple topics. With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, UN Women is supporting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) towards achieving gender equality and women's economic empowerment by 2030 to benefit all women and girls. UN Women works in partnership with governments, multilateral organizations, the UN System, civil society organizations and the private sector.
The Sustainable Development thematic area of work focuses on the need to balance resource allocation and use with the needs of current and future populations. Gender equality and women's economic empowerment cuts across all three elements of sustainable development- economic, social and environmental. Focusing on this holistic approach from a gender equality perspective will contribute to advancing women's economic empowerment and rights, and generating policy recommendations on addressing inequalities and poverty elimination, social reproduction and unpaid work conceptualized as a sustainability issue, livelihoods security, adaptation to or mitigation of climate change and social protection. Gender analysis of and policy recommendations on sectoral issues and poverty elimination including asset ownership, water and energy, education, descent work, rural development and food security, health, land tenure and land rights and environmental sustainability, will also be included in this work stream.

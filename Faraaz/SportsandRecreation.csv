You focus on what you love, coaching and training, and leave the sales and chasing new clients to us.
Here is What We Are Looking For:
First and foremost we are looking for a people person. We are known for our programs and coaching but in reality, we are in the customer service business and we work with people. One of the biggest reasons for our success is because we realize that our members are everything to our business and we do everything we can to get to know them and find out how can we motivate them and help them reach their goals.
Second, our trainers needs to be a life-long learner. One of our core values is ""always learn-constantly improve"". We're constantly learning something new and working on becoming better at what we do. We even give incentives to our coaches for continuing education.
Third, we're looking for a team player.
And last but not least we're looking for an enthusiastic, motivated, hard-working, and HIGH ENERGY PERSON (this is really important) to start working and coaching our clients as soonest possible.
About the Position
We currently offer mostly one-on-one one sessions and nutrition programs that motivate, educate, and support men and women to improve their health, fitness, and performance. Most of our programs include nutrition coaching, fitness testing, and body composition analysis.

There will be some additional hours between for fitness assessments, coaching and consultations with clients, follow-ups with clients, training on our system, meetings.

Oh yea, we’re also very fair, respectful, and appreciative. We like having fun and making money by providing highly valuable fitness services and products.
You will be compensated fairly, treated fairly and we will certainly look for ways to pay you more for your efforts if they warrant it. I want someone who enjoys working with people and making a difference in the lives of others - because that's what we do in our business.

Perform Fitness Evaluations: You'll need to perform a fitness assessment and test for: body composition, body weight, girth measurements, and various strength and flexibility tests. You do not need previous experience, but if you do, that's a bonus.
Demonstrate Proper Exercise Instruction: This is a big one. I need you to be able to provide proper coaching, instruction, and motivation during a client training session.

Basic nutrition knowledge: You've heard this one: ""You can't out-train a bad diet"". We believe in this and that is why most of our programs include the nutritional component included in the membership. Our next coach should understand the basic nutritional principles and be able to advise clients on proper nutrition.
Good Communication Skills: You will be talking with my clients, who are VERY important to me. You must be comfortable conversing in person and on the phone and know how to conduct yourself professionally, and deliver clear instructions to the clients. We'll teach you everything you need to do during a training session, but I can't teach you manners and professionalism.
People Skills and Personality: You must LOVE working with people! As mentioned above you must be very comfortable working with people. These are exciting training facilities and you must be able to show our clients energy and excitement while working with them.

You focus on what you love, coaching and training, and leave the sales and chasing new clients to us.
Here is What We Are Looking For:
First and foremost we are looking for a people person. We are known for our programs and coaching but in reality, we are in the customer service business and we work with people. One of the biggest reasons for our success is because we realize that our members are everything to our business and we do everything we can to get to know them and find out how can we motivate them and help them reach their goals.
Second, our trainers needs to be a life-long learner. One of our core values is ""always learn-constantly improve"". We're constantly learning something new and working on becoming better at what we do. We even give incentives to our coaches for continuing education.
Third, we're looking for a team player.
And last but not least we're looking for an enthusiastic, motivated, hard-working, and HIGH ENERGY PERSON (this is really important) to start working and coaching our clients as soonest possible.
About the Position
We currently offer mostly one-on-one one sessions and nutrition programs that motivate, educate, and support men and women to improve their health, fitness, and performance. Most of our programs include nutrition coaching, fitness testing, and body composition analysis.

There will be some additional hours between for fitness assessments, coaching and consultations with clients, follow-ups with clients, training on our system, meetings.
Bottom line: After your initial training is over and you're ready to start. Mac Gym facility's offer a casual, fun environment, state-of-the-art training equipment, and the opportunity to learn the inner workings of a successful fitness business.
Oh yea, we’re also very fair, respectful, and appreciative. We like having fun and making money by providing highly valuable fitness services and products.
You will be compensated fairly, treated fairly and we will certainly look for ways to pay you more for your efforts if they warrant it. I want someone who enjoys working with people and making a difference in the lives of others - because that's what we do in our business.

Basic nutrition knowledge: You've heard this one: ""You can't out-train a bad diet"". We believe in this and that is why most of our programs include the nutritional component included in the membership. Our next coach should understand the basic nutritional principles and be able to advise clients on proper nutrition.
Good Communication Skills: You will be talking with my clients, who are VERY important to me. You must be comfortable conversing in person and on the phone and know how to conduct yourself professionally, and deliver clear instructions to the clients.

Youth Soccer Referee,Nevada Choice School Athletic Association,"Las Vegas, NV",Onsite,$25 - $30 ,rt-time,"A soccer referee does more than wear a striped shirt and blow a whistle. A referee's role in the game includes work prior to the first kick and continues until after the game concludes. Understanding the critical nature of a referee's role in a soccer match helps you enjoy the game, whether you're watching the pre-K kids tumble over one another like puppies or observing a championship match.
Pre-Game Safety
In recreational leagues, a soccer referee conducts an audit of each team to ensure they're ready to play. He makes sure every player has the proper gear and often asks players to pound on their shinguards to prove they have them on. The referee also checks that jewelry is removed. Earrings, bracelets and necklaces aren't typically allowed in recreational leagues due to the potential for injury. The referee also confirms that each team is fielding a sufficient number of players to avoid forfeiting the match.
Game Safety
A referee plays an active role during the match itself. This role may be shared with assistant referees, but for smaller fields just one referee covers the entire pitch. This means a referee must be active, moving with the ball without actively interfering with play. This movement ensures that the referee is near the action if a player pushes or intentionally trips another player. Referees act as a safety net for all players, making sure the rules are followed and sportsmanlike play is enforced.
Time and Score Keeper
In recreational matches, without a large scoreboard to keep the crowd and players apprised of the time left and points scored, the referee keeps track of game time and the score. The referee typically uses a stopwatch to track quarters and halves, pausing the clock for timeouts. The referee may also use a counting device to track the score.
Post-Game
The referee typically must report injuries to the managing association after a game is complete. Particularly in youth leagues, where injury may be difficult to determine on-site, referees play a critical role in ensuring that the league follows up with the player. In professional leagues, this role is managed by the coaches and staff of the player's team. In addition, if any coach or player violated the rules of fair play as defined by the league, the referee creates a report and provides the league with a full description.

The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues.

Relationship Building: Staff and volunteers are open, friendly, and approachable to all YMCA members and participants. Staff and volunteers initiate interaction with and between members.
Education and Conversion: Staff and volunteers know about and share their knowledge of the YMCA, its programs, its policies, its mission, its values, and how it benefits members and the community.
Volunteerism and Leadership: Staff and volunteers create opportunities for members to volunteer in their areas of interest, and they ask members to do so whenever appropriate.
Staff and volunteers encourage members to “own” the YMCA, using words such as “we,” “us,” and “our association” (and actions that match those words) to include members as well as staff and volunteers.

About Fury Volleyball Club:

Fury Volleyball Club was founded in late April of 2019 by coach Erik Welker and his wife Jessica when they acquired a small space inside of a facility located in downtown Woodstock. During the Fall of that same year, they held their inaugural season club tryouts, resulting in 8 super-charged, high-octane club teams. Three of those teams went on to compete in the Open Division, and their 12U team topped the charts, ranking 2nd in the region and 32nd in the Nation! In March of 2020, Fury Volleyball Club exited their Woodstock location in search of a space that could facilitate their exponential growth. Three months later, they inked a deal on a 31,000+ square foot facility with 6 volleyball courts in downtown Canton, GA at The Mill on Etowah. In August of 2022, they closed on 3.5 acres for development of a state-of-the-art 10 court facility, expected to be completed in Winter of 2023",Referee,Sport and Recreation

"Health Coach (Remote, Part time)",Fella Health (YC W20/S21),Remote,Onsite,"$65,000 ",rt-time,"About Fella Health
Fella Health is the telemedicine clinic for men with obesity, backed by Y Combinator. With Fella, patients meet an obesity specialist to prescribe FDA-approved medications, while they undertake personalized health coaching through our app.
Obesity is the largest chronic disease in the US (>$100bn spent each year) and the traditional solution (""move more, eat less"") only works long-term for ~10% of people. But obesity treatment is radically changing due to a new wave of medication options which are 3x more effective than previous options. In addition, only 10% of those using weight management services are men: all programs market to women, not tackling the stigma men feel around this.
Fella's founder is Richie Cartwright. Richie personally struggled with binge eating for 6 years. After studying at Cambridge University, he built and sold an AI company working with the UK government. He built a 10k-follower Instagram community around men's binge eating.

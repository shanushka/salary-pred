About Noble Smoke
For 25 years, Chef Jim Noble chased his dream of making barbecue all over the South, crisscrossing the Carolinas, traveling to Texas twice, and sampling ribs and pork sandwiches everywhere in between. Off the road, he'd get lost in books and cookbooks, reading up on a tradition that is nothing short of personal to pitmasters and diners alike.
The opening of Noble Smoke marks the end of this long journey. It's a tribute to the legendary pitmasters that made (and sometimes broke) the rules. It's a heartfelt demonstration of Noble's longtime love for smoked meats. Most of all, it's a place to relax Southern-style and enjoy some great barbecue with friends.

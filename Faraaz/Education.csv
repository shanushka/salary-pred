Prompt Engineer and Librarian,Anthropic,"San Francisco, CA 94111",Hybrid remote,"$175,000 - $335,000 ",r - Full-time,"Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe for our customers and for society as a whole.

Anthropic’s AI technology is amongst the most capable and safe in the world. However, large language models are a new type of intelligence, and the art of instructing them in a way that delivers the best results is still in its infancy — it’s a hybrid between programming, instructing, and teaching. You will figure out the best methods of prompting our AI to accomplish a wide range of tasks, then document these methods to build up a library of tools and a set of tutorials that allows others to learn prompt engineering, as well as work with high value partners to directly solve their challenges.

Given that the field of prompt-engineering is arguably less than 2 years old, this position is a bit hard to hire for! As a result, we ask that you share with us a specific prompt engineering project on LLMs that you’re proud of in your application! Ideally this project should show off a complex and clever prompting architecture or a systematic evaluation of an LLM’s behavior.
Representative Projects
Discover, test, and document best practices for a wide range of tasks relevant to our customers.
Build up a library of high quality prompts or prompt chains to accomplish a variety of tasks, with an easy guide to help users search for the one that meets their needs.
Build a set of tutorials and interactive tools that teach the art of prompt engineering to our customers.
Work with large enterprise customers on their prompting strategies.
You may be a good fit if you:
Have at least a high level familiarity with the architecture and operation of large language models.
Are an excellent communicator, and love teaching technical concepts and creating high quality documentation that helps out others.
Are excited to talk to motivated customers and help solve their problems.
Have a creative hacker spirit and love solving puzzles.Have at least basic programming skills and would be comfortable writing small Python programs.
Have an organizational mindset and enjoy building teams from the ground up.
You think holistically and can proactively identify the needs of an organization.
Make ambiguous problems clear and identify core principles that can translate across scenarios.
Have a passion for making powerful technology safe and societally beneficial.
You anticipate unforeseen risks, model out scenarios, and provide actionable guidance to internal stakeholders.
Think creatively about the risks and benefits of new technologies, and think beyond past checklists and playbooks.
You stay up-to-date and informed by taking an active interest in emerging research and industry trends.
Annual Salary (USD)
The expected salary range for this position is $175k - $335k.

Compensation and Benefits*
Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

Benefits - Benefits we offer include:
Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.
Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.
401(k) plan with 4% matching.
21 weeks of paid parental leave.
Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!
Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.
Fertility benefits via Carrot.
Daily lunches and snacks in our office.
Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.

This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position, in San Francisco, CA, as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

-

Company-wide hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time. However, different roles may have different requirements - if this role has a different preference, it will be noted above.

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Come work with us! Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",librarian,Education

APPLICATION EVALUATION - qualifying
All applications will be reviewed to determine whether or not the stated requirements are met. Applicants meeting the stated requirements will be invited to continue to the next step in the examination process.
TRAINING & EXPERIENCE EVALUATION: A Training and Experience Evaluation (T&E) is a structured evaluation of the job application materials submitted by a candidate, including the written responses to the supplemental questionnaire. The T&E is NOT a determination of whether the candidate meets the stated requirements; rather, the T&E is one method for determining whoa re the better qualified among those who have shown that they meet the stated requirements. In a T&E, applications are either scored or rank ordered according to criteria that most closely meet the business needs of the department. Candidates are typically scored/ranked in relation to one another; consequently, when the pool of candidates is exceptionally strong, many qualified candidates may receive a score or rank which is moderate or even low resulting in them not being advanced in the process.

NOTE : The selection process will likely consist of an Oral Exam, which may be preceded or replaced with the score from a Training and Experience Evaluation (T&E), contingent upon the size and quality of the candidate pool. In a typical T&E, your training and experience are evaluated in relation to the background, experience and factors identified for successful job performance during a job analysis. For this reason, it is recommended that your application materials clearly show your relevant background and specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities. It is also highly recommended that the supplemental questions within the application are completed with care and diligence.

Examinees must earn a score of seventy percent (70%) or higher to qualify for placement on the eligible list.

If there are three (3) or fewer qualified applicants, an oral examination will not be conducted. Instead, a score of seventy percent (70%) will be assigned to each application, and each applicant will be placed on the eligible list.

Applicants successfully completing the examination process may be placed on an eligible list for a period of one (1) year.

Librarian,The Primary School,"East Palo Alto, CA",Onsite,"$63,000 ",r,"ABOUT US
The Primary School is creating a new school model that brings together all of the adults in a child's life, including parents, educators, and medical and mental health providers, starting from a very early age. We recognize the entrenched racism that exists within our public systems and the unjust impact this has had on families of color. Our aim is that children and families most impacted by systemic poverty and racism receive the multidisciplinary support they deserve to be well, learn, and thrive.
Long-term, we hope to create a game-changing school model that can be replicated across the country. As we continue to learn and grow, we plan to share what we've learned and pursue policy and systems change on a local, state, and national level. We are supported by a growing coalition of philanthropic partners, building on the generous support of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
Our approach has three defining characteristics:
We start early. We start working with children as young as 18 months and provide full-time school starting at age three to reach them at a critical stage in development.
We partner with parents. We believe that when parents thrive, children thrive, so we support the wellness and growth of parents alongside the growth of their children.
We integrate services. Our unique model unites health care and education, building a multi-disciplinary team and holistic system of care around a child's full needs.
In 2016, we opened our flagship school in East Palo Alto, California, with our first class of four year olds. We have grown to serve over 300 children and their families through a birth to three program, parent wellness program, full-day preschool, and elementary school, which will grow through eighth grade. In 2021, we opened our second site in the East Bay.
ABOUT OUR EAST PALO ALTO SITE
We are continuing to grow our East Palo Alto site and are excited to launch 6th grade for our 2023-2024 school year. In our school program, we currently serve over 350 students across two preschool grades (3 and 4 year olds) and kindergarten through fifth grade. Integrated into our program are the other core components of our model including our parent program - partnering closely with parents throughout their child's development and providing wellness programming for caregivers; our birth to 3 program - coordinating early developmental screenings and intervention services; and our medical home partnerships - working with existing health care providers in the community to coordinate care for children.

Librarian,The Primary School,"East Palo Alto, CA",Onsite,"$63,000 ",r,"ABOUT US
The Primary School is creating a new school model that brings together all of the adults in a child's life, including parents, educators, and medical and mental health providers, starting from a very early age. We recognize the entrenched racism that exists within our public systems and the unjust impact this has had on families of color. Our aim is that children and families most impacted by systemic poverty and racism receive the multidisciplinary support they deserve to be well, learn, and thrive.
Long-term, we hope to create a game-changing school model that can be replicated across the country. As we continue to learn and grow, we plan to share what we've learned and pursue policy and systems change on a local, state, and national level. We are supported by a growing coalition of philanthropic partners, building on the generous support of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
Our approach has three defining characteristics:
We start early. We start working with children as young as 18 months and provide full-time school starting at age three to reach them at a critical stage in development.
We partner with parents. We believe that when parents thrive, children thrive, so we support the wellness and growth of parents alongside the growth of their children.
We integrate services. Our unique model unites health care and education, building a multi-disciplinary team and holistic system of care around a child's full needs.
In 2016, we opened our flagship school in East Palo Alto, California, with our first class of four year olds. We have grown to serve over 300 children and their families through a birth to three program, parent wellness program, full-day preschool, and elementary school, which will grow through eighth grade.

Integrated into our program are the other core components of our model including our parent program - partnering closely with parents throughout their child's development and providing wellness programming for caregivers; our birth to 3 program - coordinating early developmental screenings and intervention services; and our medical home partnerships - working with existing health care providers in the community to coordinate care for children.

Comp Sci High is a new public charter high school serving the South Bronx, enrolling its founding 9th grade class in August of 2018.
Our founding team came together to start CSH because we believe that students in the Bronx can and will join the next generation of programmers, tech entrepreneurs, computer scientists, and overall become leading professionals with tech skills for any industry. We wanted to build a new kind of high school-a high school that truly prepares kids for their lives after graduation. We also wanted to build a community of adults with strong connections to each other, to kids and families, and to the Bronx community.
We are looking for an inspiring, talented, visionary, and educator to join our amazing team, help us continue to build our school, and, one day, lead one of the city’s best and most innovative high schools.
Our Mission
To ensure every student graduates with a college acceptance letter, high tech skills, real work experience, and a robust plan to turn those opportunities into a successful career where they will achieve the median income of the U.S. by the age of 25.
Our Values and Beliefs
At CSH, we value diverse views and ideas. But, we believe that every adult in our community needs to share a core set of values and beliefs in order to give our students and families the school they deserve.

KEY ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES
Launch your teaching career with a team of extraordinary educators! DSST’s
Apprentice Teacher (AT) Program
is a year-long teaching residency designed to support you in learning to teach at DSST Public Schools while also earning a competitive salary.

Key Differences between Apprentice Teachers and DSST Teachers:

An Apprentice Teacher, unlike a DSST Teacher, does not have the responsibility of managing the learning and culture of his/her own classroom until the end of the year. In the beginning of the Apprentice Teaching experience, the Apprentice Teacher will not assume full responsibility for long term planning, daily planning; assessment creation, data analysis, or behavior management- the DSST Mentor Teacher will manage all of these classroom components and help the Apprentice Teacher transition to managing more on their own as the year progresses. By the end of the year, it is the goal of the Apprentice Teacher to manage the majority of long and short-term planning, assessment creation, data analysis, and behavior management so that they are ready to assume full leadership of a classroom in the following school year.
Apprentice Teacher Pathway

DSST Apprentice Teachers commit to the following pathway to support their development as a teacher. Enrollment and good standing in this pathway is a requirement for continued participation in the DSST Apprentice Teacher Program.
Relay Residency Program (Licensure and master's degree pathway): Most DSST Apprentice Teachers (including recent college graduates and career changers) enroll in the highly acclaimed Relay Teacher Residency program. For math and science teaching candidates, this preferred partner program is aligned with DSST’s core teaching practices and is highly regarded by our DSST Apprentice Teacher alums.

KEY ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES
Launch your teaching career with a team of extraordinary educators! DSST’s
Apprentice Teacher (AT) Program
is a year-long teaching residency designed to support you in learning to teach at DSST Public Schools while also earning a competitive salary.

Key Differences between Apprentice Teachers and DSST Teachers:

An Apprentice Teacher, unlike a DSST Teacher, does not have the responsibility of managing the learning and culture of his/her own classroom until the end of the year. In the beginning of the Apprentice Teaching experience, the Apprentice Teacher will not assume full responsibility for long term planning, daily planning; assessment creation, data analysis, or behavior management- the DSST Mentor Teacher will manage all of these classroom components and help the Apprentice Teacher transition to managing more on their own as the year progresses. By the end of the year, it is the goal of the Apprentice Teacher to manage the majority of long and short-term planning, assessment creation, data analysis, and behavior management so that they are ready to assume full leadership of a classroom in the following school year.
Apprentice Teacher Pathway

DSST Apprentice Teachers commit to the following pathway to support their development as a teacher. Enrollment and good standing in this pathway is a requirement for continued participation in the DSST Apprentice Teacher Program.
Relay Residency Program (Licensure and master's degree pathway): Most DSST Apprentice Teachers (including recent college graduates and career changers) enroll in the highly acclaimed Relay Teacher Residency program. For math and science teaching candidates, this preferred partner program is aligned with DSST’s core teaching practices and is highly regarded by our DSST Apprentice Teacher alums.

Personal Finance Teacher,School Administrative Unit 6,"Claremont, NH 03743",Onsite,Full-time,Full-time,"POSITION TITLE: Personal Financial Literacy Teacher
REPORTS TO: School Principal

Purpose of Position:
The personal finance instructor has the important work of teaching student’s financial literacy skills. Your duties as a personal finance teacher are to plan and teach a course on various money-managing strategies that prepares students for life after school. Your class will cover the following topics:

I. Earning Income
Most people earn a wage and salary income in return for work, and they can also earn income from interest, dividends, rents, entrepreneurship, business profits, or increases in the value of investments. Employee compensation may also include access to employee benefits such as retirement plans and health insurance. Employers generally pay higher wages and salaries to more educated, skilled, and productive workers. The decision to invest in additional education or training can be made by weighing the benefit of increased income-earning and career potential against the opportunity costs in the form of time, effort, and money. Spendable income is lower than gross income due to taxes assessed on income by federal, state, and local governments.
II. Spending
A budget is a plan for allocating a person’s spendable income to necessary and desired goods and services. When there is sufficient money in their budget, people may decide to give money to others, save, or invest to achieve future goals. People can often improve their financial well-being by making well-informed spending decisions, which include critical evaluation of price, quality, product information, and method of payment. Individual spending decisions may be influenced by financial constraints, personal preferences, unique needs, peers, and advertising.
III. Saving
People who have sufficient income can choose to save some of it for future uses such as emergencies or later purchases. Savings decisions depend on individual preferences and circumstances. Funds needed for transactions, bill-paying, or purchases, are commonly held in federally insured checking or savings accounts at financial institutions because these accounts offer easy access to their money and low risk. Interest rates, fees, and other account features vary by type of account and among financial institutions, with higher rates resulting in greater compound interest earned by savers.
IV. Investing
People can choose to invest some of their money in financial assets to achieve long-term financial goals, such as buying a house, funding future education, or securing retirement income. Investors receive a return on their investment in the form of income and/or growth in the value of their investment over time. People can more easily achieve their financial goals by investing steadily over many years, reinvesting dividends and capital gains to compound their returns. Investors have many choices of investments that differ in expected rates of return and risk. Riskier investments tend to earn higher long-run rates of return than lower-risk investments. Investors select investments that are consistent with their risk tolerance, and they diversify across a number of different investment choices to reduce investment risk.
V. Managing
Credit allows people to purchase and enjoy goods and services today while agreeing to pay for them in the future, usually with interest. There are many choices for borrowing money, and lenders charge higher interest and fees for riskier loans or riskier borrowers. Lenders evaluate the credit worthiness of a borrower based on the type of credit, past credit history, and expected ability to repay the loan in the future. Credit reports compile information on a person’s credit history, and lenders use credit scores to assess a potential borrower’s creditworthiness. A low credit score can result in a lender denying credit to someone they perceive as having a low level of creditworthiness. Common types of credit include credit cards, auto loans, home mortgage loans, and student loans. The cost of post-secondary education can be financed through a combination of grants, scholarships, work-study, savings, and federal or private student loans.
VI. Managing Risk
People are exposed to personal risks that can result in lost income, assets, health, life, or identity. They can choose to manage those risks by accepting, reducing, or transferring them to others. When people transfer risk by buying insurance, they pay money now in return for the insurer covering some or all financial losses that may occur in the future. Common types of insurance include health insurance, life insurance, and homeowner’s or renter’s insurance. The cost of insurance is related to the size of the potential loss, the likelihood that the loss event will happen, and the risk characteristics of the asset or person being insured. Identity theft is a growing concern for consumers and businesses. Stolen personal information can result in financial losses and fraudulent credit charges. The risk of identity theft can be minimized by carefully guarding personal financial information.

"Managing Director/Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)",Excel Academy Charter Schools,"Chelsea, MA",Onsite,"$90,000 - $150,000 ",r - Full-time,"Organization: Excel Academy Charter Schools
Campus Location: Network Team
Job Title: Managing Director/Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
Reports to: Chief Schools Officer
Organization Overview
Excel Academy was founded in 2003 with the mission to provide a high-quality, free, and public education to students in East Boston and Chelsea Massachusetts, communities that are predominantly low-income and Latinx and historically have faced significant social and educational barriers. Our success in Massachusetts is proof that the opportunity gap can be closed and we opened a new school in Rhode Island in 2022. At Excel Academy Charter Schools, we believe that when a student has the support and tools to pursue a productive post-secondary pathway aligned to their personal identity and values, it can fundamentally change their life trajectory.
At Excel Academy we learn from our students, families, and staff and make improvements. We have increasingly adapted to provide a holistic education that values our community as collaborators in the learning process, social-emotional support, equity for diverse learners, and fosters identity development. We prioritize an approach that is both rigorous and inclusive. Our team of passionate, intelligent, driven, and loving staff are at the core of the work we do.
Growth Happens Here.
About the Role
Excel Academy has built an exceptionally strong academic program that has garnered national attention for producing exceptional student results. Excel Academy Rhode Island (EARI) opened in August of 2022 with 120 5th graders. At scale, in the 2030-2031 school year, we will serve approximately 2,200 students total from Providence, North Providence, and Central Falls in grades K-12 and we will continue to run our program for 1,400 students in Massachusetts. But in the meantime, there is still work to do and growth to be made. Joining an organization at an inflection point of growth, the Managing Director/Director of DEI will support the continued development of Excel Academy Charter Schools.
After conducting stakeholder surveys, interviews, and focus groups with the support of TNTP and Trajectory of Hope; seeking community feedback from faculty, staff, and school leaders; and aggregating relevant data points, our team has identified three priority growth areas in which the Managing Director/Director of DEI will lead and support. These three priority growth areas are:
Teacher and Leader Development
The Creation of a Safe & Brave Work Environment
Retention of Teachers and Staff from Historically Marginalized Populations
The Managing Director/Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) provides focus and specialized support to lead, foster and grow our schools’ and network’s expanded DEI work. They are responsible for both defining and implementing an overarching vision of diversity, equity, and inclusion for Excel that lives across departments and people. Furthermore, this position ensures that DEI lives within our decision-making processes, strategic long-term planning, approach to learning and training, talent hiring and retention, and management. The Managing Director/Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion will report to the Chief Schools Officer and is part of the Network Leadership Team.

Position Announcement
The Department of Global Studies at the University of Oregon seeks a full-time, tenure-track Assistant Professor in Global Political Economy to start in Fall 2023. We seek a scholar who holds a Ph.D. in a relevant social science, humanities, or interdisciplinary program by the time of appointment and whose expertise addresses one or more of these areas in qualitative and/or quantitative perspective: economic globalization and its political and social impacts; international political economic institutions and processes; debt, dependency, and the legacies of colonization; and the relationships between global political economy, human development, and development strategies and policies. We are especially interested in candidates who take critical, interdisciplinary, and decolonial approaches to the global political economy; and whose teaching and research complement core foci in our department, including food systems, education, global health and wellbeing, and environment and climate change. In their application materials, candidates should address how their work supports the diversity and equity goals of the department and the university, should describe a robust research agenda, and should demonstrate a high degree of proficiency in a language appropriate for their regional specialization. We particularly welcome applications from scholars who identify with populations historically underrepresented in the academy and/or who have a proven record of mentoring students from underrepresented backgrounds.

The standard teaching load is five courses on the quarter system, with course reductions usual for pre-tenure faculty. In addition to teaching a core undergraduate course, Globalization and the Global Economy, the successful candidate will develop other undergraduate and graduate courses that explore political and economic transformations and their consequences in global comparative and regionally specific perspectives. Global Studies students bring a rich array of backgrounds, identities and experiences to the Department, including but not limited to international students, first-generation students, Dreamers, differently abled and non-traditional students and students from underrepresented ethnic and gender identities. The successful candidate must therefore have a demonstrated ability to work effectively and respectfully with students, faculty and staff from diverse backgrounds and a strong record of professional activities that contribute to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Department or Program Summary
The Department of Global Studies thrives as an interdisciplinary undergraduate and Master’s program with connections across all colleges and schools of the University of Oregon, and is a pivotal component of the new School of Global Studies and Languages. We are known for our curricular and research innovation and ethically informed community engagement. Department faculty and students conduct research fundamentally oriented toward intercultural understanding from their differing social science perspectives. Opportunities exist for research and teaching in connection with the UO’s regional research programs and centers, for example in Latin American, African, and Asian Studies. New faculty are supported through the UO’s year-long professional development program, access to the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity “bootcamp” program, and a structured departmental mentorship.

Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and nearly 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.

The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors and 100 minors offered through 13 schools and colleges; nearly 15,000 undergraduates and 5,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries.

About the Syracuse area
Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues.

About Syracuse University
Syracuse University is a private, international research university with distinctive academics, diversely unique offerings and an undeniable spirit. Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and nearly 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.

The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors and 100 minors offered through 13 schools and colleges; nearly 15,000 undergraduates and 5,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit www.syracuse.edu.

About the Syracuse area
Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.

EEO Statement
Syracuse University is an equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy covers admissions, employment, and access to and treatment in University programs, services, and activities.

Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans
Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.

Commitment to a Diverse and Inclusive Campus Community
Syracuse University maintains an inclusive learning environment in which students, faculty, administrators, staff, curriculum, social activities, governance, and all other aspects of campus life reflect a diverse, multi-cultural, and international worldview. The University community recognizes and values the many similarities and differences among individuals and groups. At Syracuse, we are committed to preparing students to understand, live among, appreciate, and work in an inherently diverse country and world made up of people with different ethnic and racial backgrounds, military backgrounds, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, cultural traditions, abilities, sexual orientations and gender identities. To do so, we commit ourselves to promoting a community that celebrates and models the principles of diversity and inclusivity.",professor,Education

About Syracuse University
Syracuse University is a private, international research university with distinctive academics, diversely unique offerings and an undeniable spirit. Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and nearly 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.

The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors and 100 minors offered through 13 schools and colleges; nearly 15,000 undergraduates and 5,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit www.syracuse.edu.

About the Syracuse area
Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.

EEO Statement
Syracuse University is an equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law.

Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans
Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.

Commitment to a Diverse and Inclusive Campus Community
Syracuse University maintains an inclusive learning environment in which students, faculty, administrators, staff, curriculum, social activities, governance, and all other aspects of campus life reflect a diverse, multi-cultural, and international worldview. The University community recognizes and values the many similarities and differences among individuals and groups. At Syracuse, we are committed to preparing students to understand, live among, appreciate, and work in an inherently diverse country and world made up of people with different ethnic and racial backgrounds, military backgrounds, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, cultural traditions, abilities, sexual orientations and gender identities.

About Syracuse University
Syracuse University is a private, international research university with distinctive academics, diversely unique offerings and an undeniable spirit. Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and nearly 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.

The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors and 100 minors offered through 13 schools and colleges; nearly 15,000 undergraduates and 5,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit www.syracuse.edu.

About the Syracuse area
Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.

EEO Statement
Syracuse University is an equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy covers admissions, employment, and access to and treatment in University programs, services, and activities.

Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans
Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.

Commitment to a Diverse and Inclusive Campus Community

Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and nearly 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.

The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors and 100 minors offered through 13 schools and colleges; nearly 15,000 undergraduates and 5,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit www.syracuse.edu.

About the Syracuse area
Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.

EEO Statement

The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law.

Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans
Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.

Commitment to a Diverse and Inclusive Campus Community

The University community recognizes and values the many similarities and differences among individuals and groups. At Syracuse, we are committed to preparing students to understand, live among, appreciate, and work in an inherently diverse country and world made up of people with different ethnic and racial backgrounds, military backgrounds, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, cultural traditions, abilities, sexual orientations and gender identities.

The Investigative Process for Public Trust Positions: Background investigations for public trust positions are conducted to gather information to determine whether applicants are reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and loyal to the U.S. The information that provided on the Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF-85P) and the Declaration for Federal Employment (OF 306) may be confirmed during the investigation. The investigation may extend beyond the time covered by this form, when necessary to resolve issues. The applicant's current employer may be contacted as part of the investigation, although the applicant may have previously indicated on applications or other forms that the applicant did not want the current employer to be contacted. If the applicant has a security freeze on their consumer or credit report file, then the agency may not be able to complete the investigation, which can adversely affect the applicant's eligibility for a public trust position or the ability to obtain Federal or contract employment. To avoid such delays, the applicant must request that the consumer reporting agencies lift the freeze in these instances.

In addition to the questions on the SF-85P, inquiry also is made about the applicant's adherence to security requirements, the applicant honesty and integrity, falsification, misrepresentation, and any other behavior, activities, or associations that tend to demonstrate a person is not reliable, trustworthy, or loyal.

After a suitability /fitness determination is made, the applicant may also be subject to continuous vetting which may include periodic reinvestigations to ensure the employee is continuing suitability for employment.

Capitol Collegiate Academy serves a critical role in the educational offerings for students in Sacramento. In 2022, just over 40% of students in California were proficient in reading and less than 40% were proficient in math. Schools in South Sacramento offer a more troubling picture.

Close to 55% of our students are reading proficiently, while their peers at schools they would otherwise attend average 20% reading proficiency.
Capitol Collegiate Academy is based on two core ideas: a cohesive school climate and a rigorous academic program. Both are grounded in the absolute belief that all students, regardless of their backgrounds, have the right to an excellent, college-preparatory education starting in kindergarten.
Our committed, exceptional staff serve 450 students in grades TK- 8. With opportunities for leadership; support from coaches and leaders; and strong, trusting, professional staff relationships, we are proud of high teacher and staff retention.
We attribute a large part of our success to the high expectations we hold for students; the support we provide for our students; and the systems that promote efficiency and focus all attention on the joy of learning. Capitol Collegiate Academy’s cohesive school climate ensures that we maximize the instructional time that we have with every student attending our school.

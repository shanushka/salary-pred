Our healthcare system is frustratingly analog.

We're the first to fully automate the integration with health record systems, paving the way for a new generation of disruptive healthtech companies.

NexHealth's engineering team is still making critical design and architecture decisions that will affect our business for years to come—getting ahead of scaling and growth issues while we address our daily challenges will be a constant tension that will require sound, calm judgment, and an adaptable mindset
Our problem requires us to build a unique and diverse set of software that presents novel challenges you probably haven't dealt with before.

Building and maintaining large PostgreSQL clusters, ETL pipelines, and data warehouses
Building fault-tolerant systems that are easy for future engineers to understand, monitor, and reason about
Making decisions based on evidence and data, collecting that evidence when needed, and helping others to collect and analyze that data rather than relying on assumptions
Communicating about your work, the consequences of your work for our customers, and what people should expect next, including likely decisions or adverse events
Minimizing threat surface area and anticipating vulnerabilities when making design decisions, even under stress
Delivering small units of value to production continuously, locking in gains so a change in priorities doesn't result in piles of unfinished work

Holding the team accountable to high standards while boosting morale and driving toward shared goals

NexHealth Values
Solve the customer's problems, not yours
When making decisions, think from the perspective of the customer. It's easy to make decisions that make our lives simpler, but not the customers.
Do the things others are not willing to do
As a Nexer, always go after the hardest problems. Pursue things at the highest quality. Move at the fastest pace.
Take ownership
Act like a founder. Own your roles, destinies, mistakes, behavior, and our mission. The buck stops with each of us - no blaming or excuses.
Say what's on your mind, with positive intent
Be direct, proactive, transparent, and frequent in your communication.
Default trust
As a Nexer, you do not have to earn trust, trust is given to you by default. If we by default trust each other, our speed of communication, feedback, information sharing, and overall improvements will be a lot faster.
Think in first principles
We first identify the problem and then break it down to its fundamentals before diving into solutions. We constantly ask ""why"" to validate our assumptions.

Machine Learning Ops Engineer,Patrick J McGovern Foundation,Remote,Onsite,"$108,000 - $145,000 ",r,"The Patrick J. McGovern Foundation (PJMF) is a private foundation dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence and data science solutions to create a thriving, equitable, and sustainable future for all. PJMF works in partnership with public, private and social institutions to drive progress on our most pressing challenges, including digital health, climate change, broad digital access, and data maturity in the social sector.

For more information, please visit our website at https://www.mcgovern.org/. Core to PJMF’s mission is inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA). We apply the IDEA framework to all we do, from growing a diverse team within the foundation to coalition building with organizations and people around the world, and to democratizing the development and rewards of AI and data.

About the Role:

PJMF’s Data Practice team connects nonprofit organizations worldwide with expert technical guidance and practical hands-on experience using advanced data approaches and tools that can simultaneously move a nonprofit forward on its data journey while unlocking new pathways to impact. The team’s approach is issue-, tech-, and region-agnostic, creating an open space for nonprofits to explore the data solutions best suited to their work, communities, and contexts – rather than limiting choices to the data solutions most accessible to them in the near term.

PJMF’s Data Practice seeks a civic-minded, socially-conscious, and industry-experienced MLOps Engineer to join its team of technical leads and program implementation specialists in supporting nonprofit grant partners as they progress their respective data journeys. Data Practice grant partnerships are high-touch engagements between nonprofit staff with varying levels of data expertise and experienced PJMF data practitioners with industry-level skill sets. Over the course of each calendar year, Data Practice operations run on two tracks: implementation of Data Practice programs with grant partners selected in the previous calendar year, and strategy development and selection of grant and implementation partners for the next calendar year. Data Practice technical and program staff collaborate closely to both select Data Practice partners and implement Data Practice programs.

In this role, you will join the team’s Data Scientist, Cloud Engineer, and Data Engineer as a Data Practice technical lead, providing a combination of ML/DevOps instruction, mentorship, and guidance to nonprofits seeking to explore the value of integrating advanced data tools and approaches into their work. The Data Practice’s MLOps Engineer will be expected to serve as a trusted advisor to individual grant partners, with a willingness to both troubleshoot acute data challenges and engage in the co-creation of solutions designed for longer-term impact.

Relationship management, facilitated by both technical leads and program implementation specialists on the Data Practice team, is critical to creating the trusted environment required to enable and document learning between the Foundation and its grant partners, and among the grant partners themselves. We seek candidates with sharp communication skills, patience, discretion, awareness of the contexts and constraints commonly experienced by nonprofits, and a commitment to knowledge capture and continuous learning. This position will report to the Director, Data Practice.
How you will make an impact:
Advise grant partners on technology selection, software architecture design, security practices, and implementation, including productionization and scalable deployment of machine learning models and data-enabled applications
Regularly learn and implement new technologies, and play an active advisory role in developing, proving out, and (re)assessing solutions under exploration by grant partners
Lead scoping exercises with prospective and current grant partners on stability, application delivery, and availability
Maintain a strong security awareness through frequent software architecture design reviews
Keep up-to-date with latest developments in machine learning and DevOps, particularly with regard to cloud services and the use of data technology by nonprofits, and share your knowledge with the Data Practice team and grant partners
Assist in evaluating the reliability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of machine learning models and work with grant partners to identify areas of improvement
Work with individual nonprofits to connect the gap from development to production for ML and natural language processing (NLP) models under the constraints of scalability, correctness, maintainability, and efficiency
Develop scripts and processes to optimize and automate ML and NLP models in production within the cloud and bring subject matter expertise about data storage and object-oriented programing
Develop strategies to track model performance and drift, identifying models that need to be retrained
What you will need to succeed:
""Data for Good"". Understanding of / interest in the use of responsible AI for international development or social/environmental impact work
Knowledge and Expertise. MLOps experience automating processes, using data to make better decisions, using software to make processes more efficient, improving the quality of the product or service provided by an organization, and improving speed of delivery
Strategic Mindset. Systems thinker capable of analyzing and distilling observations, ideas, and feedback into team notes, memos, and slide presentations
Context Awareness & Spirit of Inquiry. Familiarity with the institutions and networks most relevant to our work. Empathy for the challenges – data or otherwise – nonprofits face in delivering impact. Desire to learn together with and from, rather than preach to, partners.
Thoughtfulness. Be a thoughtful, responsible representative of the Foundation and remain mindful of power dynamics when interacting with external stakeholders. Proactively identify potential issues or roadblocks in external relationships and follow team norms when addressing them
Creativity. Ability to see an opportunity beyond the status quo and develop a roadmap to get there
Adaptability. Entrepreneurial spirit and the ability to transition between independent, project-based, and team-based work with ease from a remote location
Teamwork. Self-management skills and ability to work as part of a nimble and fast-moving team; strong multitasking and parallel development abilities
100% Remote. Desire to work remotely, but not alone - with mature, socially minded professionals
Work eligibility. Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the U.S. We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of an employment Visa at this time.
Tech experience you will need to succeed:
Extensive knowledge & experience with Git, Linux system administration, Kubernetes/Docker, ML data pipelines, databases (SQL, NoSQL, RDS, CloudSQL, DynamoDB, Redshift, etc.), cloud services (at least AWS and/or GCP), and distributed systems
Ability to code in multiple languages (Python and SQL; R, Java, or others as well)
Strong communication and problem-solving skills with the ability to discuss projects with colleagues who have limited knowledge of ML/DevOps techniques and tools
Ability to oversee and provide input regarding infrastructure design and maintenance
What we offer:
Competitive Salary – Anticipated starting salary of $108,000 - $145,000 with flexibility based on experience
Health Coverage – Foundation-paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for employees, spouses/domestic partners, and dependents. HSA/FSA plans, life insurance, and short- and long-term disability coverage
Long-term Rewards – 401(k) retirement plan with generous matching up to 6% of annual pay, plus an additional discretionary match at the end of year
Flexible PTO – Unlimited paid time off, which allows team members to take the time they need for vacation or illness so they can return to work able to contribute fully to our mission. The foundation recognizes 11 paid national holidays per year and may also announce closure for local, regional, or state holidays
Remote Work Environment – Ability to work 100% remotely, but not alone - with mature, socially minded professionals
Wellness Support – Access to Ginger, Gympass, Headspace, and SmartSpend Plus, along with financial well-being providers
Parental Leave – Up to 6 months of gender-neutral paid leave for parents and caregivers when they have a new addition to their families

Research Scientist (roles across multiple teams),Neo Cybernetica,"Boston, MA",Remote,N,r - Full-time,"About Us
We are a next-gen cybernetics start-up backed by top-tier investors (Our seed round led by NEA).
Our work focuses on the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and simulation. We aim to push the boundaries of what intelligent systems are capable of. We're interested both in cases of autonomous operation, and in cases of human-collaborative operation. Our organization operates at the frontier of human capabilities, working actively to advance them and meaningfully improve the state of robotics and human society at large.
About the Role
By applying to this role, you will be considered for Research Scientist Positions across all roles at Neo Cybernetica, you will be responsible for doing the impossible.
You will be working at the bleeding edge of embodied intelligence with a world-class team spanning artificial intelligence, robotics, and simulation. You will be surrounded by experts from diverse backgrounds and work side-by-side to take The Next Step in Artificial Intelligence.
We believe that modern deep learning systems are amazing tools. Problems of perception and language modeling that were impossible just years ago are now trivial. Foundation models, novel supervision strategies, and multimodal techniques have fundamentally redefined the space of what is possible.
Our mission is to assemble and extend these technologies into the real world. As an organization, we are engineers first and foremost, but realize that often the most interesting and challenging research arises when theory meets reality. Our research scientists are the tip of the spear - breaking new ground through which the rest of the organization can follow.

Below are the four current areas that we are focused on:
Grounded Generation (3D reconstruction). From text to image to audio data, generative AI has advanced dramatically in the past several years. We believe that the next step in this journey is grounded generation. Specifically the ability to condition generative models on top of structured, explicit data as well as complex objectives such as multi-view spatio-temporal coherence and part deconstruction. We are specifically interested in this problem as it applies to 3D reconstruction.
The Grounded Generation position is meant for someone with a deep and specific expertise in this subject. Ideally you should have a PhD in a relevant niche and some industry experience - coupled with a deep mathematical background and general AI proficiency.
Imitation Learning. In a field that is characterized by so many different supervision schemes that it's almost impossible to list them all, imitation learning stands out as a unique field. We believe that there is particular value in learning to replicate unmapped action spaces as chains of differentiable operators.
The Imitation Learning position is meant for someone with a deep and specific expertise in this subject. Ideally you should have a PhD in a relevant niche and some industry experience - coupled with a deep mathematical background and general AI proficiency.
Physics-Informed Priors. Most modern foundation models are made with generality in mind. Made to incorporate minimal priors such that the same model can be applied to Atari and yodeling and angst teen journaling. We have a different approach: specifically building our models to function in the real world; where energy is conserved, space-time is coherent, and walls can't be hacked.
By Physics standards The Physics-Informed Priors position is meant for someone with middling physics and math skills - ideally with a focus on things like non-linear dynamics, elasticity, or statistical mechanics - and strong AI skills. By AI standards, this position is for someone with strong math and physics skills and middling AI skills. No PhD required, but some level of industry experience in or adjacent to AI is expected.
Communication. If a breakthrough is never cited, was it really a breakthrough? We believe that one of the most important, and under-emphasized aspects of research is its communication with a broader audience. This includes ad-hoc evaluation and analysis on new research and directed requests to communicate complex topics to technical audiences.
The Communication position is an entry-level position meant for someone that is extremely eager to learn about a broad range of subjects in AI. We don't require any industry experience or a particular depth in any specific subject. Instead communication skills such as writing and art coupled with strong AI fundamentals and a strong desire to learn are the core attributes that will make someone successful in this role.

We believe that the culture of a research organization is important. There are many different philosophies and approaches to making progress here. Ours is to focus maniacally on multi-disciplinary work and redefining problem statements to take advantage of the flexibility afforded to private industry. These are the core attributes that we look for across all of these roles to ensure success:
Humility. Our goal, as an organization, is to surround you with brilliant people. Nobody will be the smartest person in the room and we endeavor to build a research team that will thrive in that environment.
Pragmatism. The path to hell is paved with good intentions. There are simply too many fascinating problems in our space. We believe the core to navigating these incredible opportunities and research directions is with relentless pragmatism. What is the cheapest test we can run? What is the simplest approach to a problem that might work? What are the problems that we can push to tomorrow?
Open-mindedness. We are building this impossible. That means, by definition, that nobody knows how to do the things that we are attempting. We are all wrong, and in a handful of months we will all look like fools. Only by embracing that can we make progress.
If the above resonates with you, we would love to hear from you. At Neo Cybernetica we plan on accomplishing some truly incredible things and are looking for people just crazy enough to come along for the journey. I can earnestly say to everybody reading this: I hope you are one of those people.
I hope you're one of the crazy ones.",Data science,Software Development

Citi Consumer Technology – Software Development Engineer
Citi Consumer Technology is seeking dozens of talented entry-level Software Developments for its teams in Dallas, Texas, and Jacksonville, Fla.
We work with a variety of technologies, including Java, iOS, Android and Angular. You’ll find more information below on our roles, our interview process, and our commitment to your growth and development.
Applications are accepted year-round, with multiple start dates organized around orientation trainings.
Our Organization
The best way to think about Citi Consumer Technology is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day.
No matter what development team you’re a part of here, you’ll be solving complex challenges alongside great people.
Your Role
You’d be placed in an Agile development team, building software that impacts millions via consumer applications, customer service channels and internal software. Most teams operate in two- or four-week sprints, building software for a series of major and minor releases throughout the year.
You would have a manager who assesses your performance and evaluates your readiness for mobility or advancement, as well as a dev lead who assigns your work.
You have additional support, too. You join with a cohort of other new hires and go through training together to learn about our company, our tools and processes, and the technical skills you’ll need to succeed.
While technologies can vary slightly from team to team, our developer roles typically break down into these categories:
Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry
iOS: Swift, Xcode, MVC Architecture
Android: Java, Android Studio, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, Java Web Services
Web: Angular (latest version), Eclipse, Java, JSP, TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX
During the interview process, we will work with you to determine which of these roles best suits your skills and interests. Job offers are made with a specific developer role in mind, so you would know your specific position well in advance of joining the company.
Mobility
We highly value developers who build skills in more than one area, so over time, we will look to expose you to a variety of technologies. In fact, some of our teams will expect you to have learned more than one type of dev role within your first year or so. After demonstrating strong performance at the company, there are also opportunities for promotion or to pursue career pathways into other roles and teams.
Training
Soon after joining, you’ll go through several weeks of training to better understand our applications, team structure and processes. You’ll also have a chance to dive deeper into the technical aspects of your role so that you can hit the ground running. Our goal is to equip you with the tools you need to get off to a bright start at Citi.
But the learning can’t stop there. As technology evolves, you must adapt. Through access to additional instructor-led trainings and free access to thousands of hours of content via Udemy, Pluralsight and other online platforms, you’ll never stop growing your skillset.
Communication/Leadership
While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Software Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas.
The Most Important Thing
We believe bright people can learn new things, so while the qualifications below are important, there is one that we absolutely will not compromise on: attitude.
We’re looking for great teammates who are excited to learn new things, motivated to contribute, and eager to collaborate — not compete — with others. We’ve worked hard to build a supportive family environment, and we’re proud to say that candidates and new hires consistently notice it.
This is a place where people look out for one other, build relationships, and help each other succeed.
If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you here!
Qualifications
o Degree, certification or commensurate skills in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related field.
o Hands–on experience developing software.
o Ability to pass technical interviews consisting of basic algorithmic programming exercises.
o Must be collaborative and adaptable, with good communication skills. Prior experience working on agile teams is desirable.
Preferred/Ideal:
o Knowledge of/Experience with Java, IOS, Android, Web Development, or Salesforce App Development.
o Experience with APIs, microservices, or RESTful services.
o Familiarity with the architecture of mobile applications developed for iOS and Android, as well as responsive design for Web.
o Experience designing and interacting with databases.
o Experience implementing business critical, high volume, and highly available web-based applications.
o Experience with, or very knowledgeable in, cloud based development leveraging tools like Pivotal Cloud Foundry in a PaaS environment.
o Knowledge of/Experience with Salesforce CRM Tool.
o Knowledge of/Experience with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools such as Jenkins, Maven, Git, RTC, and/or Jira.
o Experience with Test Driven Development (TDD).
o Salesforce credentials are a plus.
o Experience with Apex development is a plus.
o Experience in the Financial industry is a plus.

Citi Consumer Technology – Software Development Engineer
Citi Consumer Technology is seeking dozens of talented entry-level Software Developments for its teams in Dallas, Texas, and Jacksonville, Fla.
We work with a variety of technologies, including Java, iOS, Android and Angular. You’ll find more information below on our roles, our interview process, and our commitment to your growth and development.
Applications are accepted year-round, with multiple start dates organized around orientation trainings.
Our Organization
The best way to think about Citi Consumer Technology is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day.
No matter what development team you’re a part of here, you’ll be solving complex challenges alongside great people.
Your Role
You’d be placed in an Agile development team, building software that impacts millions via consumer applications, customer service channels and internal software. Most teams operate in two- or four-week sprints, building software for a series of major and minor releases throughout the year.
You would have a manager who assesses your performance and evaluates your readiness for mobility or advancement, as well as a dev lead who assigns your work.
You have additional support, too. You join with a cohort of other new hires and go through training together to learn about our company, our tools and processes, and the technical skills you’ll need to succeed.
While technologies can vary slightly from team to team, our developer roles typically break down into these categories:
Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry
iOS: Swift, Xcode, MVC Architecture
Android: Java, Android Studio, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, Java Web Services
Web: Angular (latest version), Eclipse, Java, JSP, TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX
During the interview process, we will work with you to determine which of these roles best suits your skills and interests. Job offers are made with a specific developer role in mind, so you would know your specific position well in advance of joining the company.
Mobility
We highly value developers who build skills in more than one area, so over time, we will look to expose you to a variety of technologies. In fact, some of our teams will expect you to have learned more than one type of dev role within your first year or so. After demonstrating strong performance at the company, there are also opportunities for promotion or to pursue career pathways into other roles and teams.
Training
Soon after joining, you’ll go through several weeks of training to better understand our applications, team structure and processes. You’ll also have a chance to dive deeper into the technical aspects of your role so that you can hit the ground running. Our goal is to equip you with the tools you need to get off to a bright start at Citi.
But the learning can’t stop there. As technology evolves, you must adapt. Through access to additional instructor-led trainings and free access to thousands of hours of content via Udemy, Pluralsight and other online platforms, you’ll never stop growing your skillset.
Communication/Leadership
While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Software Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas.
The Most Important Thing
We believe bright people can learn new things, so while the qualifications below are important, there is one that we absolutely will not compromise on: attitude.
We’re looking for great teammates who are excited to learn new things, motivated to contribute, and eager to collaborate — not compete — with others. We’ve worked hard to build a supportive family environment, and we’re proud to say that candidates and new hires consistently notice it.
This is a place where people look out for one other, build relationships, and help each other succeed.
If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you here!
Qualifications
o Degree, certification or commensurate skills in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related field.
o Hands–on experience developing software.
o Ability to pass technical interviews consisting of basic algorithmic programming exercises.
o Must be collaborative and adaptable, with good communication skills. Prior experience working on agile teams is desirable.
Preferred/Ideal:
o Knowledge of/Experience with Java, IOS, Android, Web Development, or Salesforce App Development.
o Experience with APIs, microservices, or RESTful services.
o Familiarity with the architecture of mobile applications developed for iOS and Android, as well as responsive design for Web.
o Experience designing and interacting with databases.
o Experience implementing business critical, high volume, and highly available web-based applications.
o Experience with, or very knowledgeable in, cloud based development leveraging tools like Pivotal Cloud Foundry in a PaaS environment.

You'll complete milestones along the way, earning digital credentials to validate your skills, and will come back together with other apprentices to participate in on-going training and development focused on your professional and technical skills.

As a Software Engineer Apprentice at IBM, you’ll work as part of a larger team of experienced developers and mentors in an interactive, collaborative environment.

You'll go through your first few weeks together, learning about IBM and the skills you'll be attaining throughout your apprenticeship. Then, you'll work with your managers and mentors to progress through your personal skills roadmap, learning and demonstrating new knowledge and competencies through hands-on application with your project teams. You'll complete milestones along the way, earning digital credentials to validate your skills, and will come back together with other apprentices to participate in on-going training and development focused on your professional and technical skills.

As a Software Engineer Apprentice at IBM, you’ll work as part of a larger team of experienced developers and mentors in an interactive, collaborative environment. You’ll learn the fundamentals of development, software design, testing, and cloud computing, agile principles, IBM Design Thinking, DevOps and continuous delivery.

Citi Consumer Technology – Software Development Engineer
Citi Consumer Technology is seeking dozens of talented entry-level Software Developments for its teams in Dallas, Texas, and Jacksonville, Fla.
We work with a variety of technologies, including Java, iOS, Android and Angular. You’ll find more information below on our roles, our interview process, and our commitment to your growth and development.
Applications are accepted year-round, with multiple start dates organized around orientation trainings.
Our Organization
The best way to think about Citi Consumer Technology is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day.
No matter what development team you’re a part of here, you’ll be solving complex challenges alongside great people.
Your Role
You’d be placed in an Agile development team, building software that impacts millions via consumer applications, customer service channels and internal software. Most teams operate in two- or four-week sprints, building software for a series of major and minor releases throughout the year.
You would have a manager who assesses your performance and evaluates your readiness for mobility or advancement, as well as a dev lead who assigns your work.
You have additional support, too. You join with a cohort of other new hires and go through training together to learn about our company, our tools and processes, and the technical skills you’ll need to succeed.
While technologies can vary slightly from team to team, our developer roles typically break down into these categories:
Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry
iOS: Swift, Xcode, MVC Architecture
Android: Java, Android Studio, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, Java Web Services
Web: Angular (latest version), Eclipse, Java, JSP, TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX
During the interview process, we will work with you to determine which of these roles best suits your skills and interests. Job offers are made with a specific developer role in mind, so you would know your specific position well in advance of joining the company.
Mobility
We highly value developers who build skills in more than one area, so over time, we will look to expose you to a variety of technologies. In fact, some of our teams will expect you to have learned more than one type of dev role within your first year or so. After demonstrating strong performance at the company, there are also opportunities for promotion or to pursue career pathways into other roles and teams.
Training
Soon after joining, you’ll go through several weeks of training to better understand our applications, team structure and processes. You’ll also have a chance to dive deeper into the technical aspects of your role so that you can hit the ground running. Our goal is to equip you with the tools you need to get off to a bright start at Citi.
But the learning can’t stop there. As technology evolves, you must adapt. Through access to additional instructor-led trainings and free access to thousands of hours of content via Udemy, Pluralsight and other online platforms, you’ll never stop growing your skillset.
Communication/Leadership
While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Software Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas.
The Most Important Thing
We believe bright people can learn new things, so while the qualifications below are important, there is one that we absolutely will not compromise on: attitude.
We’re looking for great teammates who are excited to learn new things, motivated to contribute, and eager to collaborate — not compete — with others. We’ve worked hard to build a supportive family environment, and we’re proud to say that candidates and new hires consistently notice it.
This is a place where people look out for one other, build relationships, and help each other succeed.
If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you here!
Qualifications
o Degree, certification or commensurate skills in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related field.
o Hands–on experience developing software.
o Ability to pass technical interviews consisting of basic algorithmic programming exercises.
o Must be collaborative and adaptable, with good communication skills. Prior experience working on agile teams is desirable.
Preferred/Ideal:
o Knowledge of/Experience with Java, IOS, Android, Web Development, or Salesforce App Development.
o Experience with APIs, microservices, or RESTful services.
o Familiarity with the architecture of mobile applications developed for iOS and Android, as well as responsive design for Web.
o Experience designing and interacting with databases.
o Experience implementing business critical, high volume, and highly available web-based applications.
o Experience with, or very knowledgeable in, cloud based development leveraging tools like Pivotal Cloud Foundry in a PaaS environment.
o Knowledge of/Experience with Salesforce CRM Tool.
o Knowledge of/Experience with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools such as Jenkins, Maven, Git, RTC, and/or Jira.
o Experience with Test Driven Development (TDD).
o Salesforce credentials are a plus.
o Experience with Apex development is a plus.
o Experience in the Financial industry is a plus.
Locations: Dallas, TX; Jacksonville, FL
Majors: Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Development or similar

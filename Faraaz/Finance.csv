What Leads to Success
Here are some of the individual skills we know will enable you to succeed in this position. If you don't tick every box - don't worry as we can support you in both your personal and professional development:
You bring high accuracy, quality, and attention to detail everything you do.
You're able to work and learn quickly in a fast-paced and often changeable environment.
You are detail focused, analytical, and able to communicate outputs clearly and simply.
You build collaborative relationships and demonstrate the ability to influence across the business - you make change happen by working well with others.
You're customer-centric and can view what you do through customer's eyes - while remaining commercially astute.
Your colleagues know you as being a clear communicator, and someone can present persuasively and explain why something is important.
You're curious - you like to be aware of emerging technology, channels, and entertainment.
What We're Looking For
You'll be a part-qualified actuary, having passed over 4 exams, and you understand the key actuarial principles behind pricing and reserving.
You have some commercial experience in an actuarial or data science role, preferably direct or aggregator-led personal lines insurance. You may be in your first job after graduating and be looking for your next dream opportunity.
You are up to date with technical developments in the insurance industry and best practice in actuarial methods.
Owing to the nature of the role, we will need you to have a degree-level qualification (or equivalent) in Mathematics, Science, Engineering, or a related degree.
You'll know Excel, and any experience in ResQ and SQL would be a big plus.
Ideally, you will bring an understanding of the dynamics of personal lines insurance (pet insurance experience an advantage, but not essential!)
You'll be a compelling presenter with clear written and verbal communication. You'll know how to present and summarise information to diverse audiences to take them with you on the journey.
You'll know how to balance delivery in a local market, while working as part of a broader global team and brand.

Reasonable Adjustments and Support
If you need any help, support or advice at any point during the hiring process please email our Inclusion team in complete confidence. Our Inclusion team is made up of people from across our global business - and they are not the hiring managers for this role. We're here to make sure everyone has a fair and equitable experience when they're considering joining us. If you want to talk or ask any questions, we are here to listen (and we'll do what we can to flex our approach to a process that suits you.)

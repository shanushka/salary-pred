Sales Engineer
Remote Home-Based in California
We are looking to add a California-based Sales Engineer to our fast-growing team. The Sales Engineer role will encompass various tasks and responsibilities, depending on the successful applicants’ skill set, aptitude, ability, and experience. You will be working directly with DarkVision’s VP of Sales. You will regularly engage with the DarkVision executive team, our marketing and product managers and the rest of the DarkVision sales and business development team to drive downhole revenue and introduce DarkVision’s unique technology platforms to the US onshore and offshore markets.
The candidate will be based in California (location flexible); however, an exceptional candidate with the ability to deliver top-tier results while working remotely from another customer center (Houston, Midland, Pittsburgh) will also be considered.
There will be a significant amount of flexibility and freedom in the role, along with substantial growth potential, so someone looking to use that freedom to advance their career significantly will be an ideal candidate. The ability to align with the company’s strategy, make long-term decisions, plan methodically, ask informed questions, and understand the details of the market/product/technology/applications will be highly valued.
We are not looking for an impulsive candidate, fast-talking, tire-spinning, “experienced,” or likes to shoot from the hip. A skilled, competent professional with excellent fundamentals will be preferred over someone with a “deep Rolodex.” Of course, a solid track record of historical success is desirable as the successful candidate will quickly become a cornerstone of the sales organization as we continue the rapid expansion of the DarkVision business within North America.

What You Will Do In Your Role
Meeting People: The successful candidate will foster relationships with existing, new, and prospective clients. You will have a wide variety of customer interactions, including sales calls, further inquiry meetings, partnership discussions, and account management across the US.
Technical Advisory: Develop new accounts and enhance relationships with current customers by becoming their trusted technical advisor. Demonstrate strong technical understanding in the downhole Oil & Gas space to build trust in our advice and analysis.
Analysis & Strategy: Working directly with the VP of Sales and the VP of Products and Marketing, you will be driving and developing market roll-out plans, competitive reconnaissance, strategic positioning, market analysis, and overall sales/marketing plans for the company as it continues to scale-up operations.
Product Input: The company is working on an extensive and complex product roadmap. The successful candidate will contribute to critical discussions, decisions, and prioritizations of products and technologies to maximize the overall impact of the company’s resources.
Networking: The successful candidate will attend various oil and gas shows, conferences, and workshops across North America. Travel and flexibility within the US will be a big part of the role in the medium term. If you have significant travel restrictions, this is not the role for you.
Marketing Material Input: Depending on the skills and experience of the successful candidate, they will contribute to critical marketing materials, including customer case studies, conference papers, presentations, website content, videos, and other essential materials related to the product/market.
Everything & Anything: There will be a wide assortment of standard and not-so-standard tasks that you may be expected to complete inside and outside the typical sales umbrella. There’s an entrepreneurial side to the role so that no task will be either above or beneath you or anyone else in the company.
What It Is Not: We are looking for individuals who are laser-focused on what they do best, delivering a top-tier customer experience with cutting-edge technology while driving up top-line sales. You will not be expected to invoice-chase or endlessly forecast weekly revenue numbers.

The Experience You Will Bring
Requirements:
Downhole & Logging Experience: Experience selling downhole diagnostic and logging services.
Travel: Home based but very mobile within California; up to 10% travel outside of local region.
Technical Education: An Associate’s degree or technical diploma in mechanical, petroleum, chemical, electrical, or geological engineering is a minimum.

What Will Put You Ahead
Industry Knowledge and Experience: Bonus points for P&A, gas storage, wireline or well logging, and well intervention/integrity experience.
Knowledge of Regulations: Knowledge of California regulations for gas storage is an important asset.
Technical Background: A Bachelor’s degree in mechanical, petroleum, chemical, electrical, or geological engineering
Hard Working Self Starter: The successful candidate will be highly driven and career-focused. There is a large amount of flexibility and freedom in the role, so a proactive self-starter finding areas to add value for the company is an absolute must. Ultimately your success and development within DarkVision will be entirely in-line with your aptitude and work ethic.
Strategic & Professional: The successful candidate can align their priorities and daily tasks with the company goals and overall strategy. The product line is a complex technology, presented and sold to professional engineers, and you’ll be representing the company’s brand, values, and integrity. Smart, thoughtful, methodical, and calculated decision-making is critical for top performance in the role.
Communication Skills: The ability to speak, write, and communicate professionally and effectively with different audiences would help any candidate excel in the role. You will be the face of the DarkVision brand, and clear, concise communication will be critical for internal and external stakeholders.
General Competence: At DarkVision, there is a very high bar for general all-around competence and the ability to get things done quickly, thoroughly, and effectively without compromising quality. If you enjoy working with intelligent, talented, motivated people and making significant contributions to a winning team, then DarkVision is likely an excellent place for you.

Veolia Water Technologies & Solutions (VWTS) is a worldwide leader in water treatment, recovery, and reuse. We design and supply a range of equipment and systems, from food and beverage applications, to municipal water, to microelectronics ultrapure water and heavy industrial wastewater treatment.

Applications Engineers (AEs) are the first engineers our clients encounter. Alongside Sales and Process Engineering, you are responsible for developing water treatment solutions for complex use, reclamation or discharge requirements. Working with a team across time zones and continents, you own the bid – from lead qualification, through system design and costing, to contract signature and handover to Engineering.

Semiconductor facility water treatment and reuse provides a unique opportunity to string many separate unit operations into a single solution. Typically, flowsheets for reclamation include physical/chemical pretreatment, media filtration, biological treatment, ion exchange softening, membrane filtration (UF, NF, RO), and evaporation/crystallization. Designing, costing and proposing these systems requires a team of engineers and bid managers working together to navigate technical and commercial issues, address client concerns, and establish a supply chain.

A successful AE is flexible and cooperative to work the proposal as process details and priorities shift. The AE must balance design considerations, cost and schedule as the bid evolves, and ultimately lead development of a proposal document that is clear and persuasive. In addition to managing technical details, the AE must address financial and contractual parts of the bid – establishing payment terms and cash flow; reviewing performance guarantees and remedies; and reviewing the contract for project or legal risk (with significant assistance from Financial and Contract Management teams).

This AE role is defined by the individual bids underway, and the right candidates will be able to interpret the needs of the project and adjust – sometimes working quickly at a high level, sometimes wading deep into the weeds on specifications or contract terms. The ability to solve open ended problems with many possible solutions is key.

Minimum requirements:
Bachelor’s degree in an accredited Engineering field – Chemical or Mechanical preferred
Professional Engineer’s License, or the ability to obtain one within 1 year, desirable but not required
Ten (10) years’ experience in engineering or project management of industrial process solutions/equipment.

Useful skills or abilities:
Experience with industrial processes and system design – direct experience in water treatment preferred but not required
Experience designing, purchasing or building custom fabricated systems and equipment
Impeccable organization and time management
Clear, concise communication and presentation skills
Team player, with the ability to exercise good judgement under changing conditions
The role requires the ability to occasionally travel domestically and internationally

We’re an organization that champions diversity and inclusion at every rung of the ladder and are proud to be an equal opportunity workplace.

Proven track record of successfully architecting and deploying back-end applications and services
Experience with API service design, development, and deployment
Proficiency in Python, the main programming language used at Axiom

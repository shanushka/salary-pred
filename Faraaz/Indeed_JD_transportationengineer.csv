ABOUT US

In the DIVISION OF HIGHWAY DESIGN engineers have the challenge to not only improve Connecticut’s transportation system to meet operational and safety needs, but also to balance improvements against environmental, historic, cultural, community, aesthetic, and economic impacts. Engineers in the Division of Highway Design provide lead services in the development of projects that improve the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the State’s transportation system and find solutions to challenging roadway and multi-modal improvement problems. The State Design Unit consists of in-house highway design engineers who provide lead or support services in the development of capital projects. They develop design alternatives into contract plans, specifications, and construction estimates, provide technical guidance on elements such as roadway geometry, roadside safety, and highway drainage, and they also coordinate roadway improvements with stakeholders such as municipal leaders, neighborhood groups, businesses, and homeowners. The Consultant Design Unit is responsible for overseeing engineering consultant firms that assist the Department in designing larger complex projects. The Project Development Unit is responsible for identifying and scoping all transportation projects for the Division of Highway Design as well as managing all roadway related assets.

Engineers in the DIVISION OF BRIDGES work with a variety of transportation structures. They provide lead or support services in the development of capital projects as well as inspection of in-service structures. They use advanced analysis software and CADD technology to prepare designs including geometrics, drainage, structural analysis including load ratings, creating bid documents for traffic, roadway and railroad structures, as well as bridge rehabilitations or replacements, and develop specifications and cost estimates. They administer projects from project concept, through design including coordinating permits, and coordinating with municipalities and utilities, then follow the project through to construction. During construction, they review contractor developed drawings to facilitate construction, ensure contract compliance and provide support to address construction complications. Bridge engineers also perform structure inspections assuring safety, capacity and efficiency of the State’s bridge infrastructure as well as carry out detailed geotechnical analysis and hydraulic analysis and review analysis done by outside parties. In addition, bridge engineers manage projects and programs designed by consultant firms.

Engineers in the DIVISION OF TRAFFIC ENGINEERING work on a wide variety of projects and programs, ranging from designing traffic signals and computerized traffic signal systems to reviewing major commercial developments for their effects on roadway operations. Our engineers test and deploy emerging technologies to improve traffic flow and reduce emissions, and implement improvements for bicyclists and pedestrians. They also conduct studies and perform traffic flow analyses to improve safety and minimize travel delays for the public. Our traffic safety engineers use a data driven approach to implement new and innovative solutions across the roadway network proven to save lives and reduce serious injuries.

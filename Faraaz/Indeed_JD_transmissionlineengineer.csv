WHO YOU ARE: REQUIRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE
You're a knowledge seeker. Regardless of method, you have obtained and exposed yourself to knowledge centers that have qualified you to troubleshoot a variety of computing issues. You have a minimum of two years experience as an outside support resource, or three years working as internal support. You ideally have a degree in a relevant field or you're actively working toward completion of one. CompTIA and Cisco certifications are a definite plus.
Our ideal candidate has former experience working within a Service Desk and is comfortable with the rhythms of phone based, remote support and maintaining high-levels of client satisfaction in a ticket based environment.
You're getting to be the grease monkey of the IT environment. You have a firm understanding of desktop hardware and operating systems, and can use hardware diagnostic tools to address operating systems issues. You have a solid understanding of standard employee productivity suites—Microsoft Office/Outlook, and you fully understand mobile device configurations and support.
You have a basic understanding of networking principles, including:
Client-server networking, switching, and the Alphabet Soup of TCP/IP—DNS, WINS, DHCP, routing and internet.
CAT5/CAT6 wiring, including wireless security and client configuration, and network firewall and security technology.
Entry-level knowledge of Active Directory, with the ability to perform basic user-account administration tasks.
You know that maintenance tasks, consistently carried out, are essential to smooth server operations.
You're capable of monitoring and trouble-shooting backup software, reviewing hardware monitoring tools, and trouble-shooting the fundamentals.
When the baby gets sick, you know what to do. You have corporate anti-virus software experience as well as experience removing viruses and spyware.
You're career driven and motivated to put in the time and effort to get the job done right, and you take immense pride in your personal follow-through. At the same time, you can grasp what to prioritize and how best to build in some breaks for personal wellness.
As an Engineer Resident, you are available for a flexing, 9 hour shift (with standard breaks) generally performed between the hours of 7am-7pm CDT Monday-Friday. Current shift expectations are 8:00am - 5:00pm CST Monday-Friday.
You are ready to be an effective remote worker and have a dedicated, private space for a home office and already have in place a reliable, private internet connection with at least 50MBPS bandwidth. Public wifi and shared common spaces do not meet these standards. Entara will supply you with the other necessary tools and hardware to complete your tasks remotely.

WHO YOU ARE: PERSONALITY-WISE
Right Brain, Left Brain OS: You're a little bit of a fanatic when it comes to correctly implementing known solutions, but you've got a streak of Potter-ish ingenuity when something weird comes along. You break problems down, using a logical process of elimination to solve them. But you pay attention to intuitive inspiration.
Persnickety: You follow complex, detailed instructions for complex, detailed tasks. Again, you avoid even thinking, ""That's good enough.""
Bilingual in English and Tech-speak. You understand what the problem is, even when the person calling is 404, technically speaking. While they're talking, you're thinking technologically, assessing and solving their issue, then translating the solution into English before communicating it to the end-user. In other words, you speak the mainstream language recognized by Muggles.
Resilience of a rubber band: You don't snap when stretched to your limits by panicked, frustrated and/or irate users who might be operating on their last nerve. You have the temperament of a Zen monk on a Rocky Mountain high.
Appetite for learning: You're always reaching for the next apple on the knowledge tree, as well as the last piece of pizza in the box. Learning is its own reward—but it also helps when you have your eye on a job in the next tier. You like working in a managed-knowledge organization that promotes from within.
Persistent, but not stubborn: You'll be damned if you're going to give up on a problem you know you can solve, but you recognize when it's time to escalate to a higher tier. Next time, you'll have the solution at hand.
You play fair. You live by all those early childhood lessons about treating people with respect, keeping your commitments, listening to the views of others, resolving conflict through negotiation, communicating clearly, and contributing to a positive team effort. You place team success above your individual interests.

WHO YOU ARE: REQUIRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE
You're a knowledge seeker. Regardless of method, you have obtained and exposed yourself to knowledge centers that have qualified you to troubleshoot a variety of computing issues. You have a minimum of two years experience as an outside support resource, or three years working as internal support. You ideally have a degree in a relevant field or you're actively working toward completion of one. CompTIA and Cisco certifications are a definite plus.
Our ideal candidate has former experience working within a Service Desk and is comfortable with the rhythms of phone based, remote support and maintaining high-levels of client satisfaction in a ticket based environment.
You're getting to be the grease monkey of the IT environment. You have a firm understanding of desktop hardware and operating systems, and can use hardware diagnostic tools to address operating systems issues. You have a solid understanding of standard employee productivity suites—Microsoft Office/Outlook, and you fully understand mobile device configurations and support.
You have a basic understanding of networking principles, including:
Client-server networking, switching, and the Alphabet Soup of TCP/IP—DNS, WINS, DHCP, routing and internet.
CAT5/CAT6 wiring, including wireless security and client configuration, and network firewall and security technology.
Entry-level knowledge of Active Directory, with the ability to perform basic user-account administration tasks.
You know that maintenance tasks, consistently carried out, are essential to smooth server operations.
You're capable of monitoring and trouble-shooting backup software, reviewing hardware monitoring tools, and trouble-shooting the fundamentals.
When the baby gets sick, you know what to do. You have corporate anti-virus software experience as well as experience removing viruses and spyware.
You're career driven and motivated to put in the time and effort to get the job done right, and you take immense pride in your personal follow-through. At the same time, you can grasp what to prioritize and how best to build in some breaks for personal wellness.
As an Engineer Resident, you are available for a flexing, 9 hour shift (with standard breaks) generally performed between the hours of 7am-7pm CDT Monday-Friday. Current shift expectations are 8:00am - 5:00pm CST Monday-Friday.
You are ready to be an effective remote worker and have a dedicated, private space for a home office and already have in place a reliable, private internet connection with at least 50MBPS bandwidth. Public wifi and shared common spaces do not meet these standards. Entara will supply you with the other necessary tools and hardware to complete your tasks remotely.

WHO YOU ARE: PERSONALITY-WISE
Right Brain, Left Brain OS: You're a little bit of a fanatic when it comes to correctly implementing known solutions, but you've got a streak of Potter-ish ingenuity when something weird comes along. You break problems down, using a logical process of elimination to solve them. But you pay attention to intuitive inspiration.
Persnickety: You follow complex, detailed instructions for complex, detailed tasks. Again, you avoid even thinking, ""That's good enough.""
Bilingual in English and Tech-speak. You understand what the problem is, even when the person calling is 404, technically speaking. While they're talking, you're thinking technologically, assessing and solving their issue, then translating the solution into English before communicating it to the end-user. In other words, you speak the mainstream language recognized by Muggles.
Resilience of a rubber band: You don't snap when stretched to your limits by panicked, frustrated and/or irate users who might be operating on their last nerve. You have the temperament of a Zen monk on a Rocky Mountain high.
Appetite for learning: You're always reaching for the next apple on the knowledge tree, as well as the last piece of pizza in the box. Learning is its own reward—but it also helps when you have your eye on a job in the next tier. You like working in a managed-knowledge organization that promotes from within.
Persistent, but not stubborn: You'll be damned if you're going to give up on a problem you know you can solve, but you recognize when it's time to escalate to a higher tier. Next time, you'll have the solution at hand.
You play fair. You live by all those early childhood lessons about treating people with respect, keeping your commitments, listening to the views of others, resolving conflict through negotiation, communicating clearly, and contributing to a positive team effort. You place team success above your individual interests.

120,Operations Trainee - System Operator (Onsite),California ISO,"Folsom, CA 95630",Onsite,$37.39 - $62.32 ,n hour - Full-time,"Company Description

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.
As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.
The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.

Job Description

129,Associate Power Systems Technology Engineer (Remote),California ISO,"Folsom, CA 95630",Remote,$34.18 - $56.97 ,n hour - Full-time,"Company Description

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.
As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.
The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.
The California ISO is committed to the health, safety, and work/life integration of its employees, and is proud to offer flexible work arrangements. This position would be eligible to participate in a remote work capacity, but requires the ability to travel to Folsom infrequently.
Relocation assistance is available.

139,Associate Power Systems Technology Engineer (Remote),California ISO,"Folsom, CA 95630",Remote,$34.18 - $56.97 ,n hour - Full-time,"Company Description

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.
As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.
The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.
The California ISO is committed to the health, safety, and work/life integration of its employees, and is proud to offer flexible work arrangements. This position would be eligible to participate in a remote work capacity, but requires the ability to travel to Folsom infrequently.
Relocation assistance is available.

202,Associate Power Systems Technology Engineer (Remote),California ISO,"Folsom, CA 95630",Remote,$34.18 - $56.97 ,n hour - Full-time,"Company Description

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.
As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.
The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.
The California ISO is committed to the health, safety, and work/life integration of its employees, and is proud to offer flexible work arrangements. This position would be eligible to participate in a remote work capacity, but requires the ability to travel to Folsom infrequently.
Relocation assistance is available.

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.
As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.
The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.
The California ISO is committed to the health, safety, and work/life integration of it employees and is proud to offer flexible work arrangements. This position would be eligible to participate in a fully remote or hybrid schedule.
Relocation Assistance is available.

WHO YOU ARE: REQUIRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE
You're a knowledge seeker. Regardless of method, you have obtained and exposed yourself to knowledge centers that have qualified you to troubleshoot a variety of systems and infrastructure-centric issues. You ideally have a degree in a relevant field or you're actively working toward completion of one. Vendor certifications are a plus.
You are completely familiar with client-server networking and the alphabet soup of IT—DNS, WINS, DHCP, VPN, Microsoft MCSE, VMWare VCP1, Cisco CCNA/CCNP—because you have at least five years' of experience working as an outside support person or at least three years as internal support. You do not have one year of experience repeated 20 times. You've had to repeatably grow your knowledge within the environments you've managed.
Our ideal candidate has former experience working within a Service Delivery environment and has formerly worked and experience success within extended shifts and overnight support.
You're the grease monkey of the IT environment. You know the ins-and-outs of servers, desktop hardware, and operating systems, are familiar with the diagnostic tools for each, and can put those tools to good use. You are the IT version of the Tappit Brothers on NPR's Car Talk—throw any problem at them and they have the answer, or they'll find it. You have comprehensive knowledge of standard employee productivity suites (Microsoft office included), mobile device configurations and support, switching, wireless security and client configuration, and network firewall and security technology. Your knowledge of Active Directory, Windows/Linux, and Storage Area Networks is solid.
You are gaining expertise in managing cloud-based infrastructure, specifically leveraging Azure and/or AWS.
You understand that maintenance tasks are key to smooth operations and you carry them out consistently. You have an advanced handle on hardware and backup software monitoring and consider yourself the consummate trouble-shooter.
When the baby gets sick, you know what to do. You have corporate anti-virus software experience (preferably Symantec Endpoint Protection), as well as experience removing viruses and spyware. You're also prepared for trouble by being fluent in disaster recovery prevention, recovery procedures, and backup solutions.
You've got a specialty within systems and networking support, but constantly keep striving for ways to apply that knowledge further. The key to excellence—not to mention a fulfilling life—is continual learning. You consistently seek out opportunities to learn and pack a bigger punch the next time a similar issue rounds the corner.
You're available to work nights and yes, these regularly include weekends—Entara provides live coverage 24x7 just like a hospital does. We are looking for that rare breed that thrives more at midnight than at midday. You enjoy the ability to focus on your work, while relishing the increased responsibility you hold while maintaining and managing the full breadth of services offered to our clients. You are an effective hand-off and take the time to transition to day-shift, teeing up your teammates for success.
Current Shift Expectations:
In June | December scheduled days swap with other night shift engineer
6:00pm – 6:00am CST, 12-hour shifts on assigned days:
ROTATION 1: Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, and every other Wednesday
ROTATION 2: Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and every other Wednesday
You have a dedicated, private space for a home office and already have in place a reliable, private internet connection with at least 50MBPS bandwidth. Public wifi and shared common spaces do not meet these standards. Entara will supply you with the other necessary tools and hardware to complete your tasks remotely.
WHO YOU ARE: PERSONALITY-WISE
Right Brain, Left Brain OS: You're a little bit of a fanatic when it comes to correctly implementing known solutions, but you've got a streak of Potter-ish ingenuity when something weird comes along. You break problems down, using a logical process of elimination to solve them. But you pay attention to intuitive inspiration.
Persnickety: You follow complex, detailed instructions for complex, detailed tasks. Again, you avoid even thinking, ""That's good enough.""
Bilingual in English and Tech-speak. You understand what the problem is, even when the person calling is 404, technically speaking. While they're talking, you're thinking technologically, assessing and solving their issue, then translating the solution into English before communicating it to the end-user. In other words, you speak the mainstream language recognized by Muggles.
Self-Directed and Self-Driven: You'd label yourself as a hard charging, self-motivated individual. You don't need a drill sergeant barking you orders to spur yourself to action. You are constantly on the lookout for issues requiring your attention and aren't afraid to call in the troops to combat an issue that is bigger than you can handle solo.
Resilience of a rubber band: You don't snap when stretched to your limits by panicked, frustrated and/or irate users who probably tried to solve the problem themselves before calling the Service Desk and are therefore operating on their last nerve. You have the temperament of a Zen monk on a Rocky Mountain high.
Appetite for learning: You're always reaching for the next apple on the knowledge tree, as well as the last piece of pizza in the box. Learning is its own reward—but it also helps when you have your eye on a job in the next tier. You like working in a managed-knowledge organization that promotes from within as you gain experience.
Persistent, but not stubborn: You're more focused on our clients' success than being the genius who solves each issue. You'll be damned if you're going to give up on a problem you know you can solve, but you recognize when it's time to escalate to a higher tier. Next time, you'll have the solution at hand.
You play fair. You live by all those early childhood lessons about treating people with respect, keeping your commitments, listening to the views of others, resolving conflict through negotiation, communicating clearly, and contributing to a positive team effort. You place team success above your individual interests.

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.
As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.
The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.
The California ISO is committed to the health, safety, and work/life integration of its employees and is proud to offer flexible work arrangements. This position would be eligible to participate in a flexible hybrid schedule.

637,Sr Power Systems Technology Engineer (Remote),California ISO,"Folsom, CA 95630",Remote,"$106,500 - $177,500 ",r - Full-time,"Company Description

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) manages the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up 80 percent of California's power grid. We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by operating the grid reliably 24/7.
As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers.
The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others. In the same way, the California ISO operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.
The California ISO is committed to the health, safety, and work/life integration of its employees, and is proud to offer flexible work arrangements. This position would be eligible to participate in a remote work capacity, but requires the ability to travel to Folsom infrequently.
Relocation assistance is available.

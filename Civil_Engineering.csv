EXAMPLES OF DUTIES



In the DIVISION OF HIGHWAY DESIGN engineers have the challenge to not only improve Connecticut’s transportation system to meet operational and safety needs, but also to balance improvements against environmental, historic, cultural, community, aesthetic, and economic impacts. Engineers in the Division of Highway Design provide lead services in the development of projects that improve the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the State’s transportation system and find solutions to challenging roadway and multi-modal improvement problems. The State Design Unit consists of in-house highway design engineers who provide lead or support services in the development of capital projects.

ABOUT US

In the DIVISION OF HIGHWAY DESIGN engineers have the challenge to not only improve Connecticut’s transportation system to meet operational and safety needs, but also to balance improvements against environmental, historic, cultural, community, aesthetic, and economic impacts. Engineers in the Division of Highway Design provide lead services in the development of projects that improve the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the State’s transportation system and find solutions to challenging roadway and multi-modal improvement problems. The State Design Unit consists of in-house highway design engineers who provide lead or support services in the development of capital projects. They develop design alternatives into contract plans, specifications, and construction estimates, provide technical guidance on elements such as roadway geometry, roadside safety, and highway drainage, and they also coordinate roadway improvements with stakeholders such as municipal leaders, neighborhood groups, businesses, and homeowners. The Consultant Design Unit is responsible for overseeing engineering consultant firms that assist the Department in designing larger complex projects. The Project Development Unit is responsible for identifying and scoping all transportation projects for the Division of Highway Design as well as managing all roadway related assets.

Engineers in the DIVISION OF BRIDGES work with a variety of transportation structures. They provide lead or support services in the development of capital projects as well as inspection of in-service structures. They use advanced analysis software and CADD technology to prepare designs including geometrics, drainage, structural analysis including load ratings, creating bid documents for traffic, roadway and railroad structures, as well as bridge rehabilitations or replacements, and develop specifications and cost estimates. They administer projects from project concept, through design including coordinating permits, and coordinating with municipalities and utilities, then follow the project through to construction. During construction, they review contractor developed drawings to facilitate construction, ensure contract compliance and provide support to address construction complications. Bridge engineers also perform structure inspections assuring safety, capacity and efficiency of the State’s bridge infrastructure as well as carry out detailed geotechnical analysis and hydraulic analysis and review analysis done by outside parties. In addition, bridge engineers manage projects and programs designed by consultant firms.

Engineers in the DIVISION OF TRAFFIC ENGINEERING work on a wide variety of projects and programs, ranging from designing traffic signals and computerized traffic signal systems to reviewing major commercial developments for their effects on roadway operations. Our engineers test and deploy emerging technologies to improve traffic flow and reduce emissions, and implement improvements for bicyclists and pedestrians. They also conduct studies and perform traffic flow analyses to improve safety and minimize travel delays for the public. Our traffic safety engineers use a data driven approach to implement new and innovative solutions across the roadway network proven to save lives and reduce serious injuries.

The DIVISION OF FACILITIES AND TRANSIT consists of the Facilities Design, AEC Applications, Environmental Compliance, and Engineering Services (Pavement Design and Utilities Coordination) units. The Facilities Design Unit provides in-house and consultant engineering design and technical support services in the areas of Civil, Architectural, Structural, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. The primary focus is the renovation or new construction of facilities that support the roadway, bridge, rail transit, and bus transit operations. These projects include highway maintenance and repair facilities, rail stations, rail maintenance facilities, track, signal and catenary for rail operations, bus maintenance facilities, parking garages, salt sheds and both above ground and underground storage tanks, electric vehicle charging stations and solar array fields. Engineers in AEC Applications are responsible for developing and establishing electronic design standards and computer applications development, support and training. Environmental Compliance provides technical support and regulatory guidance on matters related to hazardous wastes and regulated contaminated materials. Pavement Design engineers provide design and technical support for projects that span across Connecticut’s roughly 10,000 lane-mile roadway network.

Engineers in PROJECT ADMINISTRATION are the in-house team responsible for advising, monitoring and delivering the Capital Program. The Contract Development team oversees the development of contract documents and reviews plans and specifications for consistency, completeness and accuracy to ensure capital projects are suitable for advertising. The Cost Estimating team prepares final confidential cost estimates and evaluates bids received on Department advertised projects. The Asset Management team is responsible for implementing the Department’s Highway and Transit Asset Management Plans regarding inventory, condition, lifecycle management, risk management, financial planning and investment strategies to maintain assets in a State of Good Repair and is responsible for regularly monitoring asset performance metrics and financial investments. The Pavement Management team is responsible for compiling pavement condition information and proposing cost-effective treatment strategies to optimize investments in pavements. The Program and Project Management team supports the Chief Engineer’s office in Capital Program management oversight and project prioritization as well as the identification and tracking of risks to project delivery.

Desired Skill-Sets:
Strong knowledge of structural design principles and building codes.
Ability to perform structural analysis and design for a variety of structural systems and materials.

We are looking for an energetic and motivated Structural Engineer to join our Southern California Team. Our scope of work covers structural engineering consulting in the entertainment/museum installation industry. Our structures and clientele almost exclusively live in the temporary structure world; however, our museum and architecture clients do permanent installations as well.
Please note, this is very much a structural engineering position, however, we do not design permanent buildings or bridge structures. If you want to fly Rihanna during Superbowl, this is the place, if you want to design the stadium, we suggest employment elsewhere.
The ideal candidate should have a good understanding of structural design and analyses, but also be able to perform rational based engineering, using engineering theory, to solve structural problems. Not all materials used in architectural and entertainment installations are governed by a direct code. A strong background in hands-on activities is a plus. Most of our clients are not engineers, so a strong understanding of principles and good communication skills are essential.
We are a very hard-working team, but we do not spend all of our time with our noses in our books. This job requires mostly working from home, as such, we have a good system of communication to stay involved through the day. If you think you qualify, sit through an informal meet and greet with our hiring manager to learn more and see if you fit.

You will be compensated generously for mileage and all fees are expendable. Site visits are project dependent and are not constant. There will be busy times, and slow times. Approximately 15-25% of time is spent in the field.
Desired Skill-Sets:
Strong knowledge of structural design principles and building codes.
Ability to perform structural analysis and design for a variety of structural systems and materials. Not all materials used in the architectural/show world fall into the four basic structural materials. It is our job, as engineers, to understand the materials they have and use rational approaches for safe solutions. Not all materials have codes.
Ability to prepare clear and concise technical reports and design documents not just for engineers, but often for non-engineers.
Good communication skills, including the ability to effectively communicate design concepts and requirements to clients, contractors, and other stakeholders.
Willingness to continually update skills and knowledge in the field of structural engineering.
On-site Inspections as required for structural design or structural safety considerations.

This is for a Structural Engineer I or II - 0 to 4 years experience
We are looking for an energetic and motivated Structural Engineer to join our Southern California Team. Our scope of work covers structural engineering consulting in the entertainment/museum installation industry. Our structures and clientele almost exclusively live in the temporary structure world; however, our museum and architecture clients do permanent installations as well.
Please note, this is very much a structural engineering position, however, we do not design permanent buildings or bridge structures. If you want to fly Rihanna during Superbowl, this is the place, if you want to design the stadium, we suggest employment elsewhere.
The ideal candidate should have a good understanding of structural design and analyses, but also be able to perform rational based engineering, using engineering theory, to solve structural problems. Not all materials used in architectural and entertainment installations are governed by a direct code. A strong background in hands-on activities is a plus. Most of our clients are not engineers, so a strong understanding of principles and good communication skills are essential.
We are a very hard-working team, but we do not spend all of our time with our noses in our books. This job requires mostly working from home, as such, we have a good system of communication to stay involved through the day. If you think you qualify, sit through an informal meet and greet with our hiring manager to learn more and see if you fit.

You will be compensated generously for mileage and all fees are expendable. Site visits are project dependent and are not constant. There will be busy times, and slow times. Approximately 15-25% of time is spent in the field.
Desired Skill-Sets:
Strong knowledge of structural design principles and building codes.
Ability to perform structural analysis and design for a variety of structural systems and materials. Not all materials used in the architectural/show world fall into the four basic structural materials. It is our job, as engineers, to understand the materials they have and use rational approaches for safe solutions. Not all materials have codes.
Ability to prepare clear and concise technical reports and design documents not just for engineers, but often for non-engineers.
Good communication skills, including the ability to effectively communicate design concepts and requirements to clients, contractors, and other stakeholders.
Willingness to continually update skills and knowledge in the field of structural engineering.
On-site Inspections as required for structural design or structural safety considerations.

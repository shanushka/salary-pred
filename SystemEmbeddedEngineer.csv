Atomic Semi is building a small, fast semiconductor fab. It’s the first of many projects that will upend traditional thinking on how we make chips.
It’s already possible to build this with today’s technology and some simplification. We’ll build the tools ourselves then quickly push them to more advanced geometries.
We’re building a small team of exceptional, hands-on engineers to make this happen. Mechanical, electrical, hardware, computer, and process. We’ll own the stack from atoms to architecture. Our team is optimistic about the future and we want to continue pushing the limits of technology.
Smaller is better. Faster is better. Building it ourselves is better.
We believe our team and lab can build anything. We’ve set up 3D printers, a wide array of microscopes, e-beam writers, general fabrication equipment - and whatever is missing, we’ll just invent along the way.
About the role
One of our goals is to simplify the fab. To do that, we need to build the equipment ourselves. As a hardware engineer, you’ll lead this effort. You’ll prototype equipment like lithography systems, deposition tools, vacuum chambers, precision motion control, plasma etching systems, etc.
We’re looking for a “full-stack engineer”— you’ll design, assemble and test these machines from both the MechE and EE angle. Besides these skills, good fundamental knowledge is key. We need someone with a good understanding of optics, liquids, heat transfer, physics, and chemistry.
As a hardware engineer at Atomic Semi, you’ll also be expected to assemble, inspect, test, and debug new electromechanical machines in tightly controlled conditions. You will be responsible for building new systems as well as integrating off-the-shelf products with custom solutions, such as motion stages and metrology equipment.
Responsibilities
Lead the design and development of precision mechanical components and systems
Develop and oversee detailed mechanical drawings and documentation
Perform detailed analysis and simulations to evaluate mechanical designs
Work with vendors to source components and materials
Required qualifications
Bachelor’s Degree or higher in engineering, or equivalent in skill and 2+ years of industry experience designing hardware
Electromechanical assembly design and analysis

Experience with precision engineering (vacuum chamber, nanoscale mechanical precision, etc.)
Knowledge of deposition methods (ALD, CVD, PVD)
Design for conventional machining and additive manufacturing
Knowledge of thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties for a range of metals
Desired qualifications
Familiarity with semiconductor processing
Python scripting and data visualization
Optical system design
Working at Atomic Semi
We’re an early-stage hardware startup with solid funding, world-class advisors, and a lab/office in San Francisco, CA.
Atomic Semi is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices. The annual salary range for this role is $100,000 – $170,000. Compensation is determined within the range based on your qualifications, experience, and location. Our total compensation package also includes generous equity in Atomic Semi.

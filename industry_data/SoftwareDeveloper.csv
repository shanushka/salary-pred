Citi Consumer Technology – Software Development Engineer
Citi Consumer Technology is seeking dozens of talented entry-level software developers for its teams in Dallas, Texas, and Jacksonville, Fla.
We work with a variety of technologies, including Java, iOS, Android and Angular. You’ll find more information below on our roles, our interview process, and our commitment to your growth and development.
Applications are accepted year-round, with multiple start dates organized around orientation trainings.
Our Organization
The best way to think about Citi Consumer Technology is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day.
No matter what development team you’re a part of here, you’ll be solving complex challenges alongside great people.
Your Role
You’d be placed in an Agile development team, building software that impacts millions via consumer applications, customer service channels and internal software. Most teams operate in two- or four-week sprints, building software for a series of major and minor releases throughout the year.
You would have a manager who assesses your performance and evaluates your readiness for mobility or advancement, as well as a dev lead who assigns your work.
You have additional support, too. You join with a cohort of other new hires and go through training together to learn about our company, our tools and processes, and the technical skills you’ll need to succeed.
While technologies can vary slightly from team to team, our developer roles typically break down into these categories:
Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry
iOS: Swift, Xcode, MVC Architecture
Android: Java, Android Studio, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, Java Web Services
Web: Angular (latest version), Eclipse, Java, JSP, TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX
During the interview process, we will work with you to determine which of these roles best suits your skills and interests. Job offers are made with a specific developer role in mind, so you would know your specific position well in advance of joining the company.
Mobility
We highly value developers who build skills in more than one area, so over time, we will look to expose you to a variety of technologies. In fact, some of our teams will expect you to have learned more than one type of dev role within your first year or so. After demonstrating strong performance at the company, there are also opportunities for promotion or to pursue career pathways into other roles and teams.
Training
Soon after joining, you’ll go through several weeks of training to better understand our applications, team structure and processes. You’ll also have a chance to dive deeper into the technical aspects of your role so that you can hit the ground running. Our goal is to equip you with the tools you need to get off to a bright start at Citi.
But the learning can’t stop there. As technology evolves, you must adapt. Through access to additional instructor-led trainings and free access to thousands of hours of content via Udemy, Pluralsight and other online platforms, you’ll never stop growing your skillset.
Communication/Leadership
While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Software Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas.
The Most Important Thing
We believe bright people can learn new things, so while the qualifications below are important, there is one that we absolutely will not compromise on: attitude.
We’re looking for great teammates who are excited to learn new things, motivated to contribute, and eager to collaborate — not compete — with others. We’ve worked hard to build a supportive family environment, and we’re proud to say that candidates and new hires consistently notice it.
This is a place where people look out for one other, build relationships, and help each other succeed.
If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you here!
Qualifications
o Degree, certification or commensurate skills in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related field.
o Hands–on experience developing software.
o Ability to pass technical interviews consisting of basic algorithmic programming exercises.
o Must be collaborative and adaptable, with good communication skills. Prior experience working on agile teams is desirable.
Preferred/Ideal:
o Knowledge of/Experience with Java, IOS, Android, Web Development, or Salesforce App Development.
o Experience with APIs, microservices, or RESTful services.
o Familiarity with the architecture of mobile applications developed for iOS and Android, as well as responsive design for Web.
o Experience designing and interacting with databases.
o Experience implementing business critical, high volume, and highly available web-based applications.
o Experience with, or very knowledgeable in, cloud based development leveraging tools like Pivotal Cloud Foundry in a PaaS environment.
o Knowledge of/Experience with Salesforce CRM Tool.
o Knowledge of/Experience with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools such as Jenkins, Maven, Git, RTC, and/or Jira.
o Experience with Test Driven Development (TDD).
o Salesforce credentials are a plus.
o Experience with Apex development is a plus.
o Experience in the Financial industry is a plus.

Citi Consumer Technology – Software Development Engineer
Citi Consumer Technology is seeking dozens of talented entry-level software developers for its teams in Dallas, Texas, and Jacksonville, Fla.
We work with a variety of technologies, including Java, iOS, Android and Angular. You’ll find more information below on our roles, our interview process, and our commitment to your growth and development.
Applications are accepted year-round, with multiple start dates organized around orientation trainings.
Our Organization
The best way to think about Citi Consumer Technology is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day.
No matter what development team you’re a part of here, you’ll be solving complex challenges alongside great people.
Your Role
You’d be placed in an Agile development team, building software that impacts millions via consumer applications, customer service channels and internal software. Most teams operate in two- or four-week sprints, building software for a series of major and minor releases throughout the year.
You would have a manager who assesses your performance and evaluates your readiness for mobility or advancement, as well as a dev lead who assigns your work.
You have additional support, too. You join with a cohort of other new hires and go through training together to learn about our company, our tools and processes, and the technical skills you’ll need to succeed.
While technologies can vary slightly from team to team, our developer roles typically break down into these categories:
Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry
iOS: Swift, Xcode, MVC Architecture
Android: Java, Android Studio, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, Java Web Services
Web: Angular (latest version), Eclipse, Java, JSP, TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX
During the interview process, we will work with you to determine which of these roles best suits your skills and interests. Job offers are made with a specific developer role in mind, so you would know your specific position well in advance of joining the company.
Mobility
We highly value developers who build skills in more than one area, so over time, we will look to expose you to a variety of technologies. In fact, some of our teams will expect you to have learned more than one type of dev role within your first year or so. After demonstrating strong performance at the company, there are also opportunities for promotion or to pursue career pathways into other roles and teams.
Training
Soon after joining, you’ll go through several weeks of training to better understand our applications, team structure and processes. You’ll also have a chance to dive deeper into the technical aspects of your role so that you can hit the ground running. Our goal is to equip you with the tools you need to get off to a bright start at Citi.
But the learning can’t stop there. As technology evolves, you must adapt. Through access to additional instructor-led trainings and free access to thousands of hours of content via Udemy, Pluralsight and other online platforms, you’ll never stop growing your skillset.
Communication/Leadership
While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Software Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas.
The Most Important Thing
We believe bright people can learn new things, so while the qualifications below are important, there is one that we absolutely will not compromise on: attitude.
We’re looking for great teammates who are excited to learn new things, motivated to contribute, and eager to collaborate — not compete — with others. We’ve worked hard to build a supportive family environment, and we’re proud to say that candidates and new hires consistently notice it.
This is a place where people look out for one other, build relationships, and help each other succeed.
If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you here!
Qualifications
o Degree, certification or commensurate skills in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related field.

At IBM, work is more than a job - it's a calling: To build. To design. To code. To consult. To think along with clients and sell. To make markets. To invent. To collaborate. Not just to do something better, but to attempt things you've never thought possible. Are you ready to lead in this new era of technology and solve some of the world's most challenging problems? If so, lets talk.

Your Role and Responsibilities

You will be able to learn and grow at your own pace, but we expect most apprentices will complete their learning within 12 months. Once you graduate and receive your certificate from our apprentice program, you will be eligible to apply to available full-time roles at IBM.

Who You Are
An apprenticeship is about learning. We’re seeking candidates who have the following requirements, but we know you’re just getting your career started, and we’re committed to helping you learn and grow. If you’ve had some experience with coding or development in the past, you’re exactly the type of candidate we’re looking for….

Agile principles
Container development using tools such as Docker or Vagrant
Application Development, DevOps automation, and the development toolchain (e.g. Travis, Jenkins, Junit, automated test tools)
What’s the Experience?
As an apprentice, you'll join with other apprentices in a local cohort. You'll go through your first few weeks together, learning about IBM and the skills you'll be attaining throughout your apprenticeship. Then, you'll work with your managers and mentors to progress through your personal skills roadmap, learning and demonstrating new knowledge and competencies through hands-on application with your project teams. You'll complete milestones along the way, earning digital credentials to validate your skills, and will come back together with other apprentices to participate in on-going training and development focused on your professional and technical skills.

As a Software Engineer Apprentice at IBM, you’ll work as part of a larger team of experienced developers and mentors in an interactive, collaborative environment. You’ll learn the fundamentals of development, software design, testing, and cloud computing, agile principles, IBM Design Thinking, DevOps and continuous delivery. You will also learn how to resolve IBM customer issues, debug customer problems and environments, and increase Cloud Service skills, and will build the skills to grow your career as a Software Developer. Best of all, you are a contributing member of your team, putting forward ideas, taking on responsibilities and making choices about how you get the job done just like any other IBMer.

At IBM, work is more than a job - it's a calling: To build. To design. To code. To consult. To think along with clients and sell. To make markets. To invent. To collaborate. Not just to do something better, but to attempt things you've never thought possible. Are you ready to lead in this new era of technology and solve some of the world's most challenging problems? If so, lets talk.

Your Role and Responsibilities
Are you interested in pursuing a software development career? Have you heard about agile development, but want to learn more about how it ‘works’? Are you someone that has a foundational understanding of development or programming concepts, but want to take a less traditional path to achieve it?

You will be able to learn and grow at your own pace, but we expect most apprentices will complete their learning within 12 months. Once you graduate and receive your certificate from our apprentice program, you will be eligible to apply to available full-time roles at IBM.

Who You Are
An apprenticeship is about learning. We’re seeking candidates who have the following requirements, but we know you’re just getting your career started, and we’re committed to helping you learn and grow.

Agile principles
Container development using tools such as Docker or Vagrant
Application Development, DevOps automation, and the development toolchain (e.g. Travis, Jenkins, Junit, automated test tools)
What’s the Experience?
As an apprentice, you'll join with other apprentices in a local cohort. You'll go through your first few weeks together, learning about IBM and the skills you'll be attaining throughout your apprenticeship. Then, you'll work with your managers and mentors to progress through your personal skills roadmap, learning and demonstrating new knowledge and competencies through hands-on application with your project teams. You'll complete milestones along the way, earning digital credentials to validate your skills, and will come back together with other apprentices to participate in on-going training and development focused on your professional and technical skills.

As a Software Engineer Apprentice at IBM, you’ll work as part of a larger team of experienced developers and mentors in an interactive, collaborative environment. You’ll learn the fundamentals of development, software design, testing, and cloud computing, agile principles, IBM Design Thinking, DevOps and continuous delivery. You will also learn how to resolve IBM customer issues, debug customer problems and environments, and increase Cloud Service skills, and will build the skills to grow your career as a Software Developer. Best of all, you are a contributing member of your team, putting forward ideas, taking on responsibilities and making choices about how you get the job done just like any other IBMer.

Citi Consumer Technology – Software Development Engineer
Citi Consumer Technology is seeking dozens of talented entry-level software developers for its teams in Dallas, Texas, and Jacksonville, Fla.
We work with a variety of technologies, including Java, iOS, Android and Angular. You’ll find more information below on our roles, our interview process, and our commitment to your growth and development.
Applications are accepted year-round, with multiple start dates organized around orientation trainings.
Our Organization
The best way to think about Citi Consumer Technology is that we’re a tech company inside a bank. We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day.
No matter what development team you’re a part of here, you’ll be solving complex challenges alongside great people.
Your Role
You’d be placed in an Agile development team, building software that impacts millions via consumer applications, customer service channels and internal software. Most teams operate in two- or four-week sprints, building software for a series of major and minor releases throughout the year.
You would have a manager who assesses your performance and evaluates your readiness for mobility or advancement, as well as a dev lead who assigns your work.
You have additional support, too. You join with a cohort of other new hires and go through training together to learn about our company, our tools and processes, and the technical skills you’ll need to succeed.
While technologies can vary slightly from team to team, our developer roles typically break down into these categories:
Microservices Developer: Java, Spring Framework, Pivotal Cloud Foundry
iOS: Swift, Xcode, MVC Architecture
Android: Java, Android Studio, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, Java Web Services
Web: Angular (latest version), Eclipse, Java, JSP, TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX
During the interview process, we will work with you to determine which of these roles best suits your skills and interests. Job offers are made with a specific developer role in mind, so you would know your specific position well in advance of joining the company.
Mobility
We highly value developers who build skills in more than one area, so over time, we will look to expose you to a variety of technologies. In fact, some of our teams will expect you to have learned more than one type of dev role within your first year or so. After demonstrating strong performance at the company, there are also opportunities for promotion or to pursue career pathways into other roles and teams.
Training
Soon after joining, you’ll go through several weeks of training to better understand our applications, team structure and processes. You’ll also have a chance to dive deeper into the technical aspects of your role so that you can hit the ground running. Our goal is to equip you with the tools you need to get off to a bright start at Citi.
But the learning can’t stop there. As technology evolves, you must adapt. Through access to additional instructor-led trainings and free access to thousands of hours of content via Udemy, Pluralsight and other online platforms, you’ll never stop growing your skillset.
Communication/Leadership
While much of your time will be spent coding, this is a highly collaborative environment that will also make use of your communication and influencing skills. Whether you’re working with a project manager to set a realistic deadline, helping demo a product to a business partner, or working with internal stakeholders like Software Architecture or Security, we need engineers who can clearly communicate technical concepts, be great teammates, and influence without authority. You’ll be entrusted with meaningful work that impacts our customers, and you’ll be empowered to suggest new ideas.
The Most Important Thing
We believe bright people can learn new things, so while the qualifications below are important, there is one that we absolutely will not compromise on: attitude.
We’re looking for great teammates who are excited to learn new things, motivated to contribute, and eager to collaborate — not compete — with others. We’ve worked hard to build a supportive family environment, and we’re proud to say that candidates and new hires consistently notice it.
This is a place where people look out for one other, build relationships, and help each other succeed.
If that sounds like you, we’d love to have you here!
Qualifications
o Degree, certification or commensurate skills in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or a related field.
o Hands–on experience developing software.
o Ability to pass technical interviews consisting of basic algorithmic programming exercises.
o Must be collaborative and adaptable, with good communication skills. Prior experience working on agile teams is desirable.
Preferred/Ideal:
o Knowledge of/Experience with Java, IOS, Android, Web Development, or Salesforce App Development.
o Experience with APIs, microservices, or RESTful services.
o Familiarity with the architecture of mobile applications developed for iOS and Android, as well as responsive design for Web.
o Experience designing and interacting with databases.
o Experience implementing business critical, high volume, and highly available web-based applications.
o Experience with, or very knowledgeable in, cloud based development leveraging tools like Pivotal Cloud Foundry in a PaaS environment.
o Knowledge of/Experience with Salesforce CRM Tool.
o Knowledge of/Experience with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools such as Jenkins, Maven, Git, RTC, and/or Jira.
o Experience with Test Driven Development (TDD).
o Salesforce credentials are a plus.
o Experience with Apex development is a plus.
o Experience in the Financial industry is a plus.
Locations: Dallas, TX; Jacksonville, FL
Majors: Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Development or similar

Wealthfront’s vision is to make it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth on your own terms. This vision is relevant because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We want to empower young investors to easily explore and execute on a wider range of investing strategies. We want to help them make informed investment decisions that are consistent with their values and beliefs while also making it effortless to grow and compound their savings exponentially. We believe that doing so will be transformational to their lives and their long-term future.

About Wealthfront Engineering
At Wealthfront, engineering is the largest group with over 50% of the employees. Hence engineering culture permeates throughout the organization. You will work with and learn from invigorating colleagues who come from diverse backgrounds. Very few had a finance background before starting at Wealthfront. Given our size - about 240 employees in total and about 125 employees in Engineering, you have the ability to have an outsized impact, regardless of your industry tenure. Our Banking system was designed and first developed by an engineer 3 years out of college. The Linking platform was developed by engineers with up to 6 years industry experience. When you start we will pair you up with a mentor who will guide you for as long as you want. Our culture is optimized for continued learning and automation. At Wealthfront we are builder/operators: engineers have the dual responsibility to build the system and operate the system in production, dealing with problems as they occur. This provides you direct feedback on how your code performs in production. We preach and practice automation. As an engineer, you are expected to automate any toil you encounter. No permissions required, no prioritizations expected, no questions asked. We are disciples of quality and we don’t have a separate QA organization. Engineers are expected to write automated test cases that build upon the existing test cases. For example, our investing algorithms have a dedicated suite of tests that runs full trading day simulations on a representative sample of real accounts. This testing framework allows us to test any code change against historical scenarios. If our culture of learning, the potential to have a huge impact, and our focus on quality resonates with you, then we want you!

Note: This role has the option to be based in Palo Alto CA, Boston MA, or remote (U.S)
About the Role:
We are looking for backend engineers to join our core product development teams. You’ll work with other engineers to design and build new features or enhance existing features. This work will add capabilities to the various backend systems and services that support Wealthfront’s products, and will be done with automated instrumentation and monitoring to require minimal operational maintenance.
You’ll help improve the maintainability and stability of our codebase by fixing issues and adding necessary enhancements to our existing backend systems. You’ll ensure that mission critical backend systems and services operate smoothly in production by triaging and resolving operational issues as part of a team of on-call engineers. You’ll proactively identify opportunities for improving the reliability and scalability of our systems.
Additionally, you might play a part in evolving the engineering organization by participating in recruiting activities such as interviewing and attending career fairs and providing mentorship to other engineers on the team.
About You:
You have 1-3 years of experience in developing backend components, services or APIs in Java or a similar language. You demonstrate knowledge and understanding of distributed systems and functional programming paradigms. You have knowledge of SQL and experience working with online data stores (ideally something like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server but NoSQL is okay).
You have passion for agile, test-driven development, continuous integration and automated testing. You also have a passion for working on platforms and backend systems that have measurable business impact and like working in a fast paced cross functional environment.
While not required, experience working with Spark pipelines is a plus along with knowledge of an ORM technology such as Hibernate. Another plus is working with a dependency injection framework (one of Guice, Spring, Pico, Dagger).
You have either a BS or MS in computer science or related field.
Once you join, Wealthfront will:
Pair you with a mentor who will guide you through our structured onboarding program
Encourage you to work on projects that match your professional goals
Support your professional development by providing feedback during weekly 1:1s and our semi-annual reviews
Provide you autonomy so you can be a happy and successful member of our team
Estimated annual salary range: $142,000 - $169,000 USD plus Equity.
Plus benefits include medical, vision, dental, 401K plan, generous time off, parental leave, wellness reimbursements, professional development, employee investing discount, and more!

In order to successfully serve clients across the United States, the Wealthfront team is focused on hiring team members with a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.


About Wealthfront

Wealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business, with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built the first automated investment product that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee; we then expanded into banking which made it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $27 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry. And yet, we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions.

Wealthfront’s vision is to make it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth on your own terms. This vision is more relevant than ever because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth.

\uD83C\uDF0F About Heard
Heard's (https://joinheard.com/) mission is to help therapists with their businesses.

By helping them take care of all their business needs — accounting, taxes, bookkeeping & more, we create a world where therapists can focus on the thing they know best: helping their clients.

Unlike most small businesses, mental health providers lack the tools and systems needed to understand the ins and outs of their business. They're forced to work with a disparate array of expensive services or contractors to manage their finances, their taxes, their payroll, their savings and more. Not only is this outside their area of expertise — every hour spent wrangling finances or filling out forms is one less hour spent providing care.

Heard offers therapists bookkeeping, accounting, taxes, and payroll all in one easy-to-use platform.

Heard is growing incredibly fast. We launched in Jan 2021, and most recently raised our Series A in Feb of 2022. We have a clear, well-funded pathway to becoming an industry leading software services provider for independent mental health practitioners.

13,13,Front End Engineer,Levro,California,Remote,Full-time,Full-time,"About us:
At Levro (Y S21), our mission is to build the financial backbone for global commerce. We are building financial infrastructure to allow any company to frictionlessly expand to any country. We help companies avoid complex/costly conversions, by holding 30+ different currencies in one US bank account. This means they can receive and pay funds internationally as if they had a local bank account, and our FX conversion fees are 4-8x cheaper than traditional banks.
Opening a bank account abroad as a business can be really hard: it can take up to 6 months in the UK, and you often even need to fly to Canada to open a Canadian bank account! Once accounts are open, banks charge high fees to convert between currencies, and the setup can be complicated to administer.
We closed an oversubscribed seed round from incredible fintech investors and operators, including YCombinator and the founders of Yahoo, Eventbrite, Monzo and others. We're 2x YC founders and experienced operators - Cathy founded a big data SaaS business that processed over $4bn in transactions, and Abeer built a hedge fund with over $1.5bn in AUM. As immigrant founders, we want to build the best global business bank, to give makers access to more markets and make finance as global as commerce.
Role Description:
As an early Senior Engineer, you’re sure to have a big impact! You’ll shape our product and technology direction, as well as support an engineering culture that empathizes with our customers, users, and other team members.
What You'll do:
Take our product from 0 to 1 by designing and implementing secure, highly scalable, and pragmatic technical solutions
Work closely with the founders to influence, develop, and implement product design and roadmap
Develop subject matter expertise in areas like international banking, card issuing, and machine learning for lending
Work directly with our customers to help them expand their companies around the globe

15,15,Front End Engineer,Levro,California,Remote,Full-time,Full-time,"About us:
At Levro (Y S21), our mission is to build the financial backbone for global commerce. We are building financial infrastructure to allow any company to frictionlessly expand to any country. We help companies avoid complex/costly conversions, by holding 30+ different currencies in one US bank account. This means they can receive and pay funds internationally as if they had a local bank account, and our FX conversion fees are 4-8x cheaper than traditional banks.
Opening a bank account abroad as a business can be really hard: it can take up to 6 months in the UK, and you often even need to fly to Canada to open a Canadian bank account! Once accounts are open, banks charge high fees to convert between currencies, and the setup can be complicated to administer.
We closed an oversubscribed seed round from incredible fintech investors and operators, including YCombinator and the founders of Yahoo, Eventbrite, Monzo and others. We're 2x YC founders and experienced operators - Cathy founded a big data SaaS business that processed over $4bn in transactions, and Abeer built a hedge fund with over $1.5bn in AUM. As immigrant founders, we want to build the best global business bank, to give makers access to more markets and make finance as global as commerce.
Role Description:
As an early Senior Engineer, you’re sure to have a big impact! You’ll shape our product and technology direction, as well as support an engineering culture that empathizes with our customers, users, and other team members.
What You'll do:
Take our product from 0 to 1 by designing and implementing secure, highly scalable, and pragmatic technical solutions
Work closely with the founders to influence, develop, and implement product design and roadmap
Develop subject matter expertise in areas like international banking, card issuing, and machine learning for lending
Work directly with our customers to help them expand their companies around the globe

A holistic financial health company helping every American build a brighter financial future. With a business model that is aligned with our customers, we create transparent, fair, and simple financial products that put money back in the hands of our members, help them spend wisely, avoid unfair fees and build their credit quickly. We're backed by leading VC's including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DCM, a number of the world's most influential social impact investors like Flourish and Sound, and several mission driven celebrity investors like Kevin Durant and Ashton Kutcher! If autonomy, ownership, and having meaningful input at the company you work for is important to you, come join our growing team!
Brigit is doing innovative and exciting work, but don’t just take our word for it, our work is being recognized by others:
Built In’s 2023 Best Startups to Work For In New York City

Brigit is looking for a Frontend Engineer to help us scale our next-gen consumer finance platform. Our product has tremendous traction helping 1 million+ low income Americans make ends meet. We’ve built beautifully designed, user-centric mobile and web clients with React (including React Native) and TypeScript, but we need help in making them even more user friendly & extensible.
As we approach our next phase of growth, we're scoping out new products and features helping our users save more and improve their credit options - in short, better equipping them along their financial journey. You'll have the opportunity to leverage the platform of our current frontend & backend base to build these new products from the ground up for millions of users. Financial products often come with difficult user challenges, and if you're excited by the idea of reconstructing difficult concepts into easy-to-use interfaces and products for end-users, then this is the right role for you.
Our engineering team has two main goals:
1) Ship Features supporting numerous external and internal applications. The next generation of our product may look nothing like what it does today - and we welcome that! The degree to which we design and create new features (and even new products) for users, architect our frontend-backend communications, implement design-to-development processes will make or break our success.
2) Scalability & Maintainability of our user-facing applications. Growing from 100k users to 10 million presents unique technical challenges. Because we’re growing so quickly, the efficiency and reliability of both our customer facing and internal tools needs to improve. In addition to creating new features, we have many tasks to tackle including the creation and upkeep of components & libraries, REST API design, testing & QA processes, and CI/CD enhancements.
The engineering team is small and nimble; you'll get an extraordinary amount of autonomy and ownership. More importantly, you’ll have a large say in the direction of the company - both in terms of our technology and our product. One of our greatest strengths is the speed with which we can move. If you want to propose a new way of doing things, we are all ears. If you have an idea for a new feature, we'll be open to it. A new design paradigm? Bring it on.
At Brigit you'll find engineering best practices inspired by our experiences at Palantir, Amazon, Two Sigma, a mature CI/CD process, an easy-to-use local/staging/production development environment, and teammates willing to fill in the gaps. We automate manual things so we can focus on thinking and building something that truly helps people.
What You Have
3+ years of full-time experience in the React (including React Native) & JavaScript ecosystem
Experience using HTML & CSS to create beautiful interfaces

You are a self-starter, self-motivated, and able to work independently and manage multiple projects under minimal supervision
Experience building UI/UX for new features from end-to-end
The ability to rebuild an internal dashboard from scratch which greatly enhances our internal customer success team’s efficiency
What You'll Be Doing
Implementing interaction and motion design for more delightful user experiences
Unifying our component and styling libraries to be shared across our mobile and web clients
Automating visual testing & visual regression detection processes
Creating new mobile & web clients for upcoming products
Work with the Product & Design teams to spec, build, and ship a new Financial Health Score feature

A solid product sense - we want to make robust technical decisions with the needs of our users and the business at the forefront
Experience collaborating directly with Product Managers and Designers
A love for learning new things as well as mentoring other team members on their learning journeys as well
Excellent communication skills, both via video chat (Zoom) and in written format (Slack, email, Google Docs)

Job description
This role is open to a European based software engineer who wants to work in Rust. Experience in a similar C based programming language, such as C++, or any strictly typed language is required, but the role is open to those wanting to develop their skills in the new world of Rust. Apparently we are one of the few companies in Europe who have built the entire backend in Rust from day one, so that’s neat.
We have multiple possible roles within our backend engineering team, all rust-based.

You will likely focus your efforts on one three areas:
The State Chain: we are developing our own standalone blockchain using the substrate blockchain development framework . Previous experience of working with complex type systems would be beneficial here, as would some knowledge of how blockchains work internally.

The Chainflip Engine: this application works in tandem with the State Chain to power our decentralised threshold signature protocol, and to witness events happening in the outside world. An in-depth knowledge of the challenges of distributed systems, cryptography, and Rust’s async features (specifically the tokio stack) would be great to have.

Tools and testing: security and robustness of our network will be paramount. We need to provide secure and user-friendly tools for our validators to manage their nodes. And we need to be confident our nodes function according to protocol specifications. Knowledge of security best-practices and/or a pedantic and exhaustive attitude to testing would be a big plus here.

No matter which team you join, you will be exposed to all of the tough problems and trade-offs that decentralised finance and blockchains have to offer.

Who we are ?
Chainflip is a decentralised exchange project that uses multi-party-computation and threshold signature schemes to allow our decentralised validator network to secure assets across multiple arbitrarily differentiated blockchain networks, with the ultimate goal of allowing users to swap between various cryptocurrencies across multiple blockchains in a trustless and programmatic way. We think it has the best shot at taking market share away from the big centralised exchanges in the long run and bringing it on-chain. We want to be the Uniswap for everything.
Our values
We are a Berlin-centric team with our own office space in the heart of Kreuzberg, but we have remote workers throughout Europe, a new office in Dublin, and a team in Melbourne, Australia. We meet up as a whole team twice a year, have a very open and flexible culture, and enjoy meaningful personal connections with one another. Our team has a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences to share, and hopefully you’ll be able to share yours with us too.",Developer,Software Development

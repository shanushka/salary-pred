ABOUT US

In the DIVISION OF HIGHWAY DESIGN engineers have the challenge to not only improve Connecticut’s transportation system to meet operational and safety needs, but also to balance improvements against environmental, historic, cultural, community, aesthetic, and economic impacts. Engineers in the Division of Highway Design provide lead services in the development of projects that improve the safety, capacity, and efficiency of the State’s transportation system and find solutions to challenging roadway and multi-modal improvement problems. The State Design Unit consists of in-house highway design engineers who provide lead or support services in the development of capital projects. They develop design alternatives into contract plans, specifications, and construction estimates, provide technical guidance on elements such as roadway geometry, roadside safety, and highway drainage, and they also coordinate roadway improvements with stakeholders such as municipal leaders, neighborhood groups, businesses, and homeowners. The Consultant Design Unit is responsible for overseeing engineering consultant firms that assist the Department in designing larger complex projects. The Project Development Unit is responsible for identifying and scoping all transportation projects for the Division of Highway Design as well as managing all roadway related assets.

Engineers in the DIVISION OF BRIDGES work with a variety of transportation structures. They provide lead or support services in the development of capital projects as well as inspection of in-service structures. They use advanced analysis software and CADD technology to prepare designs including geometrics, drainage, structural analysis including load ratings, creating bid documents for traffic, roadway and railroad structures, as well as bridge rehabilitations or replacements, and develop specifications and cost estimates. They administer projects from project concept, through design including coordinating permits, and coordinating with municipalities and utilities, then follow the project through to construction. During construction, they review contractor developed drawings to facilitate construction, ensure contract compliance and provide support to address construction complications. Bridge engineers also perform structure inspections assuring safety, capacity and efficiency of the State’s bridge infrastructure as well as carry out detailed geotechnical analysis and hydraulic analysis and review analysis done by outside parties. In addition, bridge engineers manage projects and programs designed by consultant firms.

Engineers in the DIVISION OF TRAFFIC ENGINEERING work on a wide variety of projects and programs, ranging from designing traffic signals and computerized traffic signal systems to reviewing major commercial developments for their effects on roadway operations. Our engineers test and deploy emerging technologies to improve traffic flow and reduce emissions, and implement improvements for bicyclists and pedestrians. They also conduct studies and perform traffic flow analyses to improve safety and minimize travel delays for the public. Our traffic safety engineers use a data driven approach to implement new and innovative solutions across the roadway network proven to save lives and reduce serious injuries.

The DIVISION OF FACILITIES AND TRANSIT consists of the Facilities Design, AEC Applications, Environmental Compliance, and Engineering Services (Pavement Design and Utilities Coordination) units. The Facilities Design Unit provides in-house and consultant engineering design and technical support services in the areas of Civil, Architectural, Structural, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. The primary focus is the renovation or new construction of facilities that support the roadway, bridge, rail transit, and bus transit operations. These projects include highway maintenance and repair facilities, rail stations, rail maintenance facilities, track, signal and catenary for rail operations, bus maintenance facilities, parking garages, salt sheds and both above ground and underground storage tanks, electric vehicle charging stations and solar array fields. Engineers in AEC Applications are responsible for developing and establishing electronic design standards and computer applications development, support and training. Environmental Compliance provides technical support and regulatory guidance on matters related to hazardous wastes and regulated contaminated materials. Pavement Design engineers provide design and technical support for projects that span across Connecticut’s roughly 10,000 lane-mile roadway network.

Engineers in PROJECT ADMINISTRATION are the in-house team responsible for advising, monitoring and delivering the Capital Program. The Contract Development team oversees the development of contract documents and reviews plans and specifications for consistency, completeness and accuracy to ensure capital projects are suitable for advertising. The Cost Estimating team prepares final confidential cost estimates and evaluates bids received on Department advertised projects. The Asset Management team is responsible for implementing the Department’s Highway and Transit Asset Management Plans regarding inventory, condition, lifecycle management, risk management, financial planning and investment strategies to maintain assets in a State of Good Repair and is responsible for regularly monitoring asset performance metrics and financial investments. The Pavement Management team is responsible for compiling pavement condition information and proposing cost-effective treatment strategies to optimize investments in pavements.

Most of our clients are not engineers, so a strong understanding of principles and good communication skills are essential.
We are a very hard-working team, but we do not spend all of our time with our noses in our books. This job requires mostly working from home, as such, we have a good system of communication to stay involved through the day. If you think you qualify, sit through an informal meet and greet with our hiring manager to learn more and see if you fit.

Diverse Assignment Experience - defined as one in which significantly new job skills or knowledge will be/were acquired and successfully demonstrated. These skills must add value to broaden the individual for career path progression to support business needs of the company. New job skills mean a significant change in tasks performed, not just an amplification of existing skills. Rotation to another Energy Northwest organization would usually constitute a diverse assignment; rotation within an organization generally would not be considered diverse. However, the possibility of diverse rotation within an organization exists. Conversely, cross organizational assignments in some groups may not qualify as diverse if the skills or knowledge required are essentially the same. Supervisors and individual contributors should plan future job assignments with the criteria of diversity in mind. A minimum of one-year job duration is recommended to qualify as a diverse assignment. This allows for a full round of performance feedback to document that expected skill or knowledge was attained. Experience within Energy Northwest or external to the company (including external to the nuclear industry) may be credited as diverse assignments. These experiences will be evaluated by Nuclear Projects leadership and Human Resources on an individual basis. The experience must have produced skill or knowledge in an area comparable to those needed within Energy Northwest. Some examples of possible diverse assignments external to Energy Northwest are: startup experience at a fossil plant, design activities for an AE organization, military experiences, time spent as a craftsperson, within the aerospace or semi-conductor industry, or in a QA/QC position. It is recognized that the relative value of an experience may vary between organizations. This list is not intended to be all inclusive and discretion for consideration will be considered by senior manager responsible for Nuclear Projects and Human Resources.

The career stage has two parts – the first identifies whether the role is a manager (M), an individual contributor (IC), an admin-technician-retail (ATR) job, or an intern. The second part identifies the relative seniority of the role – a higher number (or later letter alphabetically in the case of ATR) indicates greater scope and complexity.

They use advanced analysis software and CADD technology to prepare designs including geometrics, drainage, structural analysis including load ratings, creating bid documents for traffic, roadway and railroad structures, as well as bridge rehabilitations or replacements, and develop specifications and cost estimates. They administer projects from project concept, through design including coordinating permits, and coordinating with municipalities and utilities, then follow the project through to construction. During construction, they review contractor developed drawings to facilitate construction, ensure contract compliance and provide support to address construction complications. Bridge engineers also perform structure inspections assuring safety, capacity and efficiency of the State’s bridge infrastructure as well as carry out detailed geotechnical analysis and hydraulic analysis and review analysis done by outside parties. In addition, bridge engineers manage projects and programs designed by consultant firms.

Engineers in the DIVISION OF TRAFFIC ENGINEERING work on a wide variety of projects and programs, ranging from designing traffic signals and computerized traffic signal systems to reviewing major commercial developments for their effects on roadway operations. Our engineers test and deploy emerging technologies to improve traffic flow and reduce emissions, and implement improvements for bicyclists and pedestrians. They also conduct studies and perform traffic flow analyses to improve safety and minimize travel delays for the public. Our traffic safety engineers use a data driven approach to implement new and innovative solutions across the roadway network proven to save lives and reduce serious injuries.

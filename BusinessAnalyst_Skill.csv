Business Analyst Job Responsibilities
If you read our business analyst job posting and thought, “That sounds great, but what is this job actually like?”, then keep reading!
The core function of our role as business analysts at Grant Street Group is to be a liaison between our developers and our clients, and this requires us to wear many different hats.
So what do all of these “hats” really mean?
Problem Solving: Every day you work to solve complex problems. When you analyze a calculation, investigate the cause of a bug, or propose a new process you are venturing into unfamiliar territory to find a solution. Our clients and developers rely on your problem solving skills to ensure our software is built and supported effectively.
Client support: When a customer has a question, problem, or suggestion, they come to you! You are known as a subject matter expert and our clients rely on that expertise regularly. Whether the issue is major or minor, you know that Grant Street Group takes Software as a Service literally.
Prioritization: Our software is ever-changing. With that comes the need to prioritize what, when, and how changes are made. Since you’re working with the software and our clients daily, who better to prioritize than you? Business analysts are constantly asking themselves: Does this feature need to be completed before a certain time? What is the impact of this bug? How can other clients benefit from this change? We use a ticketing system to track pieces of work such as functionality requests and bug fixes. We then prioritize them for developers to work on.
Technical Specifications: It’s your job to convey to the developers what changes need to be made. What happens when you click this button? What does the page look like? How is this file transferred to an external system? In this way, you are directly affecting the product and our clients’ experience.
Testing: When a developer completes a change, you get to test it out (in a beta environment) to ensure that it’s working correctly. Does the new behavior match the specification? Does everything else surrounding the change still work correctly?
Implementations: We’re a growing company and adding new clients is an exciting part of that growth! Since you’re a subject matter expert, you coordinate with new clients to configure the software to best fit their needs. Think of yourself as a consultant. What business processes does the client need to accomplish? How can our software fit in with and help that process?
Training: Helping clients learn about how our software works is also part of your role. Whether it’s a new client coming up to speed on how tasks are completed, or an existing client that is incorporating a new feature into their process, you’re a resource for providing the information and tools they need.
Does this sound exciting and overwhelming at the same time? Most of us thought so too. If you haven’t had experience in this area before, know that many of us lacked business analyst experience before we came to Grant Street Group. What we did have was intellectual curiosity and a passion for problem solving. If you’ve already had business analyst experience, that’s great, and we’re excited about the possibility of you continuing on that path with us.
So now that you know what we do, why are you a great fit? You’ve probably spent a large majority of your life asking “Why” and then making sure that you figure out the answer. You love using all parts of your brain equally, and the thought of speaking with a client or learning about a database schema equally intrigues you. You’re the one that people rely on in team projects. You’re always itching to know more and you hold yourself and others to a high standard.
Before you begin the interview process, keep in mind that we have a tendency to pay special attention to those that put in extra effort in their applications. We are radical proponents of the belief that you are more than just a resume. If you’re excited about this opportunity, we can’t wait to get to know you!",Business Analyst,['database']

About Us//
Indoor rock climbing has become an incredibly popular mainstream sport and will soon be featured in the Olympic Games. Nearly every state in the nation is now home to at least one rock climbing gym, and all forecasts predict the sport will only continue to grow. We intend to grow with it!
The Front Climbing Club was Utah's first indoor rock-climbing gym, and one of the first in the nation. From our humble beginnings as The Body Shop back in the 80's to three best-in-class facilities today, we have never lost our soul or connection to our roots.
Like all industries, there are some who do it poorly, some who do it well, and some who do it best. Vertical Solutions, The Front Climbing Club's sister company and the nation's largest domestic climbing wall manufacturer, does it best. We build indoor climbing walls throughout the country with distinctive materials that set us apart from (and above) the competition, and we have set the industry standard for design and aesthetics. Our walls are fabricated at our headquarters in Salt Lake City by an expert team of carpenters and welders and shipped to job sites across the country for assembly by our traveling field crew. VS also produces a full fleet of climbing holds and pads, and offers in-depth business development consulting, making us the only true full-service gym builder in the U.S. The rapid expansion of our company and industry ensures ample opportunity for career development and upward mobility.
We do not offer easy jobs. We simply cannot slow down enough to kick back and relax while we are at work, but we highly encourage you to shut off your devices and email and disappear into the mountains on your own time.
Our culture is built on this level of work ethic, as well as integrity, community (we do not use that word lightly), and unity.

For over 20 years we've scoured the earth to find hotels that stand out for their style, service, and personality — regardless of price. In fact, our painstaking curation led to Michelin making us the official hotel selection of their legendary MICHELIN Guide. The MICHELIN Guide has always been a benchmark in gastronomy. Now it’s setting the same standard for hotels.
Our mission is to open doors to places people will love that they might not have found on their own, extraordinary places that reflect the beauty and diversity of the world. Our team believes that travel brings people of all backgrounds together. Our hotels provide an unforgettable backdrop for that union.
Headquartered in New York City, we operate in eight languages, bringing the top 1% of hotels in over a hundred different countries around the world to our discerning clientele via our website and app. And if you really want to take it to the next level, our Plus membership program provides VIP upgrades and amenities at hundreds of our properties.
Business Analyst
In addition to our own channels, Tablet provides the hotel booking infrastructure for the MICHELIN Guide’s website and apps. Booking hotels online is a complicated operation; our systems interface with multiple platforms to access, display and transact real-time rates and availability and support multiple currencies and region-specific display and privacy requirements. Our hotel selection is constantly changing, adding new, extraordinary hotels and phasing out others on a regular basis. Information we show on our platforms come from internal teams, hotel partners, our users, and third parties, and needs to come together in a seamless, hyper intuitive interface that smooths the path from searching to booking to getting on your way to an incredible hotel stay. We operate like a startup within Michelin, offering high impact opportunities as we influence the digital transformation for the Michelin Experiences group (gastronomy and travel).
As our Business Analyst, you’ll develop the foundation for design decisions and your work will clarify requirements for the engineering team. You’ll be responsible for understanding and codifying the sources, formats, relationships and rules for every data element in our systems and how each is accessed, managed, and used across our platforms. You will be tasked with documenting user flows and data dependencies for specific features and functionality and developing recommendations for how to deploy new features and make improvements on existing ones. Along the way, you will need to vet potential solutions by devising and running user research and testing, monitor competitor movement to inform our priorities and plans, and define tracking requirements to gauge performance.
You’ll report to Tablet’s co-founder who is now both Chief Creative Officer for Tablet Hotels and Chief Product Officer for Michelin Experiences. This is a highly visible and influential role that collaborates with our executive team and every department throughout the company in order to holistically understand the business, target audience, product ecosystem, and unique informational and data challenges as they relate to elevating user experience, driving revenue, and pushing customer retention. Success requires an ability to harness user data, team feedback, market research, and emerging digital design trends in developing compelling navigation models, site maps, and transaction flows. Impeccable documentation and organizational skills will be invaluable.
Tablet is a flat organization where even the executive team operates as hands-on peers. If you’re self-directed, self-motivated, and do better work when you're trusted with a healthy amount of freedom and flexibility, we may be an excellent fit.
